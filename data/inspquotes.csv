I first learned that there were black people living in some place called other than the United States in the western hemisphere when I was a very little boy, and my father told me that when he was a boy about my age, he wanted to be an Episcopal priest, because he so admired his priest, a black man from someplace called Haiti.;Henry Louis Gates;age
Why should 20-year-olds only be considered sexy? I think we get better with age.;Jenny McCarthy;age

Sure I played, did you think I was born at the age of 70 sitting in a dugout trying to manage guys like you?;Casey Stengel;age

The funniest racism is the racism between minorities. It's something you don't see dramatized, but almost every minority I know who's my age, they have these funny stories about their parents stereotyping other minorities.;Mindy Kaling;age
It's ironic that at age 32, at probably the greatest moment of my career, with The Godfather having such an enormous success, I wasn't even aware of it, because I was somewhere else under the deadline again.;Francis Ford Coppola;age
I'm asked all the time in interviews about who I am, and I know a few people my age who have a strong sense of self, but I couldn't say I know myself and sum it up and give it to you in a little package. I don't know myself at all yet.;Kristen Stewart;age
Alexander at the head of the world never tasted the true pleasure that boys of his own age have enjoyed at the head of a school.;Horace Walpole;age

In this age of media and Internet access, we are much more talkative than ever before.;David Duchovny;age
Over the years Woodstock got glorified and romanticised and became the event that symbolised Utopia. It's the last page of our collective memory of the age of innocence. Then things turned ugly and would never be the same again.;Ang Lee;age
Every time I see something terrible, it's like I see it at age 19. I keep a freshness that way.;Ralph Nader;age
I hate to mention age, but I come from an era when we weren't consumed by technology and television.;Jimmy Buffett;age

Morality comes with the sad wisdom of age, when the sense of curiosity has withered.;Graham Greene;age
Every age yearns for a more beautiful world. The deeper the desperation and the depression about the confusing present, the more intense that yearning.;Johan Huizinga;age
To be told that one can be dependent on one's parents until age 26 should strike a young person who wants to grow up as demeaning, not as something to celebrate.;Dennis Prager;age
Does age matter? Time doesn't matter.;Sandra Bullock;age
I figured out it was a social thing, what women were allowed to do. At a very young age, I decided I was not going to follow women's rules.;Joan Jett;age
We were really grown up for our age and it was an incredible special band.;Joan Jett;age
Age is the first limitation on roles that I've ever had to encounter, and I hit that awhile ago.;Jack Nicholson;age

The secret of long life is double careers. One to about age sixty, then another for the next thirty years.;David Ogilvy;age

The age in which we live, this non-stop distraction, is making it more impossible for the young generation to ever have the curiosity or discipline... because you need to be alone to find out anything.;Vivienne Westwood;age
I can feel the 60S looming. In my profession, I've just moved along with my age. By thinking in decades, rather than whether someone's 42 or 47, you can give yourself a whole 10 years to turn yourself around in.;Francesca Annis;age
We all know now that people can look good for their age. It isn't so extraordinary, I don't know why people go on about it so much.;Francesca Annis;age
A lot of music you might listen to is pretty vapid, it doesn't always deal with our deeper issues. These are the things I'm interested in now, particularly at my age.;Annie Lennox;age
Life expectancy in many parts of Africa can be something around the age of thirty five to thirty eight. I mean you're very fortunate if you live to that age. In fact when I went to Uganda for the first time one of the things that occurred to me was that I saw very few elderly people.;Annie Lennox;age
Light and funny has a more compelling quality when you're younger. But I haven't abandoned the genre: I love falling down I love Lucille Ball. It's just that a lot of those stories revolve around problems that I can't convincingly portray at this age.;Julia Roberts;age
I had the good fortune to be able to right an injustice that I thought was being heaped on young people by lowering the voting age, where you had young people that were old enough to die in Vietnam but not old enough to vote for their members of Congress that sent them there.;Birch Bayh;age

I'm not busy... a woman with three children under the age of 10 wouldn't think my schedule looked so busy.;Garrison Keillor;age

What I think is amazing is not that 85% of people who get married under the age of 25 get divorced, it's that 15% of them stay together. How did they manage to pull that off? You almost can't wait too long. It's the single simplest measure to predict divorce.;Elizabeth Gilbert;age
I avoid talking before the youth of the age as I would dancing before them: for if one's tongue don't move in the steps of the day, and thinks to please by its old graces, it is only an object of ridicule.;Horace Walpole;age
I'm glad I was born when I was. My time was the golden age of variety. If I were starting out again now, maybe things would happen for me, but it certainly would not be on a variety show with 28 musicians, 12 dancers, two major guest stars, 50 costumes a week by Bob Mackie. The networks just wouldn't spend the money today.;Carol Burnett;age
I was taught from a young age that many people would treat me as a second-class citizen because I was African-American and because I was female.;Queen Latifah;age

The Word of fire burns today On the lips of our prophets in an evil age.;Margaret Walker;age
What is wrong with the Iranians in addition to the nuclear bomb? This is the only country on Earth in the 21st century that has renewed imperialistic ambitions. They really want to become the hegemon of the Middle East in an age that gave up imperialism.;Shimon Peres;age
I think it's quite extraordinary that people cast me as if I'm Warren Beatty: until I met my present wife, at the age of 35, you could name two girlfriends.;Colin Firth;age
Craziest thing I've done for love is getting married. I think it's crazy. I think it's crazy, crazy, crazy. I'm never going to say I wouldn't do it again but I have to make sure it's love and not settling for the 'I have to do this by a certain age,' which is kind of what I did.;Jenny McCarthy;age
You never choose the way that you're raised, it's just the way that you were raised, but you do get to a certain age where you're in a position to question the expectations of you and the way that you've been formed by your surroundings.;Mia Wasikowska;age
We tried not to age, but time had its rage.;Pete Townshend;age

Young man, the secret of my success is that an early age I discovered that I was not God.;Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.;age
I'd like to talk about free markets. Information in the computer age is the last genuine free market left on earth except those free markets where indigenous people are still surviving. And that's basically becoming limited.;Russell Means;age
I would often find myself, at the age of 21, at midnight, running down a dark street on my own with 10 men chasing me. And the fact they had cameras in their hands made that legal.;Sienna Miller;age

There are only two things a child will share willingly communicable diseases and its mother's age.;Benjamin Spock;age
Although it is generally known, I think it's about time to announce that I was born at a very early age.;Douglas Horton;age
I think it's your mental attitude. So many of us start dreading age in high school and that's a waste of a lovely life. 'Oh... I'm 30, oh, I'm 40, oh, 50.' Make the most of it.;Betty White;age
No, no, I was only funny on stage, really. I, I, think I was funny as a person toward my classmates when I was very young. You know, when I was a child, up to about the age of 12.;Rowan Atkinson;age
What goes on in Europe concerns us greatly because, if Europe comes apart, the E.U. comes apart, then you're going to have enormous impact on America, that's a very big trading partner of ours, and people own securities around the world in this day and age.;Michael Bloomberg;age
Your body actually reminds you about your age and your injuries - the body has a stronger memory than your mind.;Mikhail Baryshnikov;age
People dance at any age.;Mikhail Baryshnikov;age
I never had little brothers, so I was totally not used to hearing a lot of cussing at a young age! I learned what 'pull my finger' meant the hard way.;Danica McKellar;age
My sister and I shared a bedroom our entire lives and I believe she discovered the Beatles when she was about 11 and I'm four years younger. So from the age of 7 until 17 we had nothing but Beatles paraphernalia in our room, even those little stuffed Beatles that went on stands that are dressed as the Sgt. Pepper band.;Christina Ricci;age
But look, I was born in 1956, the peak year for births in US history. I think I'm very representative of many of the thought processes my generation have been through and, by and large, people of my age have had their imprint planted on the consciousness of western society for a long time.;Tom Hanks;age
I basically get stereotyped a lot in terms of being a girl and writing 'chick' music for teenage girls or something. I think, if anything, the press kind of, because of my gender and my age, tends to kind of relegate my work to this sort of special-interest group. It's part of the cultural dynamic, I guess.;Ani DiFranco;age
What is amazing for a woman of my age is that I change as the world is changing-and changing very, very fast. I don't think my mother had that opportunity to change.;Jeanne Moreau;age
I've never worried about age.;Jeanne Moreau;age
To me age is a number, just a number. Who cares?;Jeanne Moreau;age
If you're extremely, painfully frightened of age, it shows.;Jeanne Moreau;age
For a man who has compared himself to Theodore Roosevelt and the nation's challenges to those of the Gilded Age, Obama put forward a tepid agenda.;Ron Fournier;age

Everyone talks about age, but it's not about age. It's about work ethic. Winning never gets old.;Lisa Leslie;age

Science cannot tell theology how to construct a doctrine of creation, but you can't construct a doctrine of creation without taking account of the age of the universe and the evolutionary character of cosmic history.;John Polkinghorne;age
I came of age believing that, no matter what happened, I would always be able to support myself.;William J. Clinton;age
'Dallas' hit a chord back in the late Seventies and Eighties because it was the age of greed: here you have this unapologetic character who is mean and nasty and ruthless and does it all with an evil grin. I think people related to JR back then because we all have someone we know exactly like him. Everyone in the world knows a JR.;Larry Hagman;age
I've never been more in love with anyone nearly half my age than I am today. I'd get married in a minute if I weren't still married to somebody else.;Rod Stewart;age
At my age you don't go into fatherhood lightly.;Rod Stewart;age
I didn't know a time when there wasn't a war because I spent all my time from the age of two or three to eight in a coal cellar really.;David Bailey;age
My best friend just had a baby, and she's my age. So I'm a godmom now, which is crazy.;Kristen Stewart;age
I think I'm a bit less inhibited, and not thinking too much before speaking. It's not about being shameful, I'm just a bit more unabashedly myself because of this thing, and it probably started at age 15. I can be around people and say what I think without fear.;Kristen Stewart;age
At a certain age, death becomes familiar to you-or a loss becomes familiar-the tragedies that are more commonplace in life.;Jessica Lange;age
TV is sort of the only way to go for an actress my age to make a decent salary with independent films, you just can't.;Jessica Lange;age
Memory in youth is active and easily impressible in old age it is comparatively callous to new impressions, but still retains vividly those of earlier years.;Charlotte Bronte;age
At its best our age is an age of searchers and discoverers, and at its worst, an age that has domesticated despair and learned to live with it happily.;Flannery O'Connor;age
Study after study confirms that even when you control for variables like profession, education, hours worked, age, marital status, and children, men still are compensated substantially more - even in professions, like nursing, dominated by women. No wonder there's a gender gap.;Dee Dee Myers;age
I learned from a very young age that if I pursued the things that truly excited me, that they would reward in more important ways, like happiness.;Brandon Boyd;age
I always wanted to be a designer. I read books on fashion from the age of 12.;Alexander McQueen;age
When I was a little kid I used to play with guys twice my age, so, I was the last one picked, so if I picked I knew that I had to get the ball to the scorer if I wanted to stay on the court, so that was pretty much my job.;Jason Kidd;age
We have become a society that can't self-correct, that can't address its obvious problems, that can't pull out of its nosedive. And so to our list of disasters let us add this fourth entry: we have entered an age of folly that - for all our Facebooking and the twittling tweedle-dee-tweets of the twitterati - we can't wake up from.;Thomas Frank;age
The divine right of husbands, like the divine right of kings, may, it is hoped, in this enlightened age, be contested without danger.;Mary Wollstonecraft;age
In every age there has been a stream of popular opinion that has carried all before it, and given a family character, as it were, to the century.;Mary Wollstonecraft;age
Look, demanding somebody do anything in this day and age is not going to fly.;John Mayer;age
I was very successful from a very early age, and I want to keep it.;John Mayer;age

Most of the basic material a writer works with is acquired before the age of fifteen.;Willa Cather;age
I would always encourage people of any age not to be so quick to follow other people's truths but to search and follow your own moral code and live by your own integrity, and mostly just be brave.;Jewel;age
I don't believe in happy endings, but I do believe in happy travels, because ultimately, you die at a very young age, or you live long enough to watch your friends die. It's a mean thing, life.;George Clooney;age
Even truth needs to be clad in new garments if it is to appeal to a new age.;Georg C. Lichtenberg;age
You can have a spiritual awakening and discover a new side of you at any age. And best of all, love can happen at any age. Life can just start to get exciting when you're in your 40s and 50s. You have to believe that.;Salma Hayek;age
America doesn't reward people of my age, either in day-to-day life or for their performances.;Meryl Streep;age
I really think we should pass a law in every state, I don't care whether it takes the independence away from an old person or not. You shouldn't be driving a car if you're over the age of 80. Maybe even less than that.;Evel Knievel;age
I think I'm past the age of getting lost.;Amanda Seyfried;age
I conceived in art college at the age of 20, near the end of term.;Joni Mitchell;age
I've been screaming at the top of my lungs at my family, 'Work out! Work out! Old age is coming!';Cher;age
It is not classified as a pagan religion. The so-called New Age activities and this are not called religions and therefore don't come under the prohibition of mingling church and state that we have in this country.;Dixie Lee Ray;age
No sex, age, or condition is above or below the absolute necessity of modesty but without it one vastly beneath the rank of man.;Bruce Barton;age
People tend to become more emotionally intelligent as they age and mature.;Daniel Goleman;age

Whoever, fleeing marriage and the sorrows that women cause, does not wish to wed comes to a deadly old age.;Hesiod;age
Age has been the perfect fire extinguisher for flaming youth.;Navjot Singh Sidhu;age
I prefer younger men. In some ways, they are much more open to a woman being stronger and independent then some of the men my age.;Kim Cattrall;age
You have to be desirable. And that's why so many woman of my age or even younger are pushed to Botox and plastic surgery, all the things that people say, 'Why do women do this?' Where do you go in your 50s in your career?;Kim Cattrall;age
It is my art. I am better at it than I ever was. And I will do it as long as I can. When you reach a certain age you can slough off what is unnecessary and concentrate on what is. And why not?;Arthur Miller;age
I feel like a lot of the female relationships I see on TV or in movies are in some way free of the kind of jealousy and anxiety and posturing that has been such a huge part of my female friendships, which I hope lessens a little bit with age.;Lena Dunham;age
At my age, no one is married, no one has kids, no one has a career.;Lena Dunham;age
One of the many pleasures of old age is giving things up.;Malcolm Muggeridge;age
There's also some element of coming of age during the Reagan administration, which everybody has painted as some glorious time in America, but I remember as being a very, very dark time. There was apocalypse in the air the punk rock movement made sense.;John Cusack;age
If you explode onto the scene at a very young age, there are so many people pulling you in different directions. It takes time to recalibrate and see what's important.;Clive Owen;age
Situational unawareness in the private marketplace or on the battlefield will cost you your livelihood or your life. In the Age of Obama, however, such willful ignorance is a job prerequisite. The less you know the better.;Michelle Malkin;age
We virtually never feel our age, but thinking that we should can lead to disaster.;Martha Beck;age
We grew up in a very creative environment and were exposed to the arts at a very young age, so it's not a surprise that all of us are in some form of the arts.;Spike Lee;age
I want to be part of the resurgence of things that are tangible, beautiful and soulful, rather than just give in to the digital age. But when I talk to people about this they just say, 'Yeah, I know what you mean,' and stare at their mobiles.;Jack White;age
I wanted to do two things when I was growing up, about your age. I wanted to play in the NBA, and I wanted to be a businessman after my basketball career was over, and that is what I am doing now.;Magic Johnson;age
The idea of regretting not doing this seemed insane to me. Sitting in the corner at a bar at age 60, saying: 'I could've been Bond. Buy me a drink.' That's the saddest place I could be. At least now at 60 I can say: 'I was Bond. Now buy me a drink.';Daniel Craig;age
There's a vintage which comes with age and experience.;Jon Bon Jovi;age
It's not the normal way to look at things but I experienced death at a really young age and because of that it's been part of my mental landscape that death is really very possible.;Cate Blanchett;age
I've an enormous respect for my mother who at the age of 39 raised three children, and I grew up with my grandmother in the household. And so it was a really strong household of women - my poor brother! It was great growing up with so many generations of women.;Cate Blanchett;age
Every age develops its own peculiar forms of pathology, which express in exaggerated form its underlying character structure.;Christopher Lasch;age
I love my kids, and the moments I have with them, and it's kind of weird, it's such an age old cliche, but the way that my sons, the way they make me feel when I look at them, the way they say things, no one else would probably react to them, but it's a special thing for me.;Michael Rapaport;age
There's a very small group of elite actresses who are my age, who people want to work with. It's not easy to get a good job with good actors.;Amanda Peet;age
A final word: I am not knowledgeable about the internet. I do not have a computer. I guess that at 74 years of age, I don't have the patience to learn.;David Wilkerson;age
It lies in human nature that where you experience your first laughs, you also remember the age kindly.;Vaclav Havel;age
We tried not to age, but time had its rage.;Patti Smith;age
Michelle Pfeiffer hasn't been finding a lot of work recently because she doesn't like what a woman her age is offered. That's a real double standard. You get Sean Connery, who gets older and older, still playing opposite young ladies, but it doesn't work the other way around.;Denzel Washington;age
Old age and treachery will always beat youth and exuberance.;David Mamet;age
My wife and I, unlike many intellectuals, spent five years working on assembly lines. We came to fully understand the criticisms of the industrial age, in which you are an appendage of a machine that sets the pace.;Alvin Toffler;age
Even one voice can be heard loudly all over the world in this day and age.;Aung San Suu Kyi;age
At this age, I should be leading a quiet life.;Aung San Suu Kyi;age
Any new financial order for the world must tackle the three chief challenges of our age.;James Buchan;age
There are signs that the age of petroleum has passed its zenith. Adjusted for inflation, a barrel of crude oil now sells for three times its long-run average. The large western oil companies, which cartellised the industry for much of the 20th century, are now selling more oil than they find, and are thus in the throes of liquidation.;James Buchan;age
With the song 'This Christmas' I wanted to do something that was kind of different. I mean, Donny Hathaway is an amazing artist. So I wanted to bring my flavor to the song so when people over the age of 45 or 50 hear it they'll be like 'OK, he did his thing with that record.' It's like I can appeal to everybody and not just a younger demographic.;Chris Brown;age
In an age when the fashion is to be in love with yourself, confessing to be in love with somebody else is an admission of unfaithfulness to one's beloved.;Russell Baker;age
Rereading A.J. Liebling carries me happily back to an age when all good journalists knew they had plenty to be modest about, and were.;Russell Baker;age

I believe the true function of age is memory. I'm recording as fast as I can.;Rita Mae Brown;age
So Harry Potter came in and it is nice that I have kids of the right age. I took them to London and they walked around the set and met Harry Potter and that is thrilling.;Gary Oldman;age
All we can do when we think of kids today is think of more hours of school, earlier age at the computer, and curfews. Who would want to grow up in that world?;James Hillman;age
The reason for the sadness of this modern age and the men who live in it is that it looks for the truth in everything and finds it.;Edmond de Goncourt;age
No, but way before that, I've been doing little dances in movies for years. Yeah, that was an amazing chance. You know, at my age to be able to do a music dance video, very unusual.;Christopher Walken;age
There probably aren't a lot of actors my age who tap dance.;Christopher Walken;age
I started auditioning when I was about 10 and I didn't get my first job until I was 12, and two years at that age is really hard.;Anna Kendrick;age
I remember being in Hollywood at the age of 16 and marveling at the stars. The idea of being part of it never entered my mind. It was too far-fetched.;Bryan Adams;age
The older generation had greater respect for land than science. But we live in an age when science, more than soil, has become the provider of growth and abundance. Living just on the land creates loneliness in an age of globality.;Shimon Peres;age
One of my grandfathers, actually, having gone out there as a minister, decided he would better serve the people as a doctor. So at a very late age - at the age of 38 in fact - he changed course and decided to become a doctor.;Colin Firth;age
I'm totally into new age and self-help books. I used to work in a bookstore and that's the section they gave me, and I got way into it. I just loved the power of positive thinking, letting yourself go.;Jason Mraz;age
It's the kind of clothes that mothers and daughters can wear, in terms of concept... It's not about age. It's about taste, and it's about lifestyle. I believe women of all ages can wear anything.;Ralph Lauren;age
The reason for the slow progress of the world seems to lie in a single fact. Every man is born under the yoke, and grows up beneath the oppressions of his age.;John Jay Chapman;age
A newspaper is lumber made malleable. It is ink made into words and pictures. It is conceived, born, grows up and dies of old age in a day.;Jim Bishop;age
Just as we reject racism, sexism, ageism, and heterosexism, we reject speciesism. The species of a sentient being is no more reason to deny the protection of this basic right than race, sex, age, or sexual orientation is a reason to deny membership in the human moral community to other humans.;Gary L. Francione;age
I am a grandmother now, and that means age is creeping on, creeping on.;Lillie Langtry;age
I love things that age well - things that don't date, that stand the test of time and that become living examples of the absolute best.;Giorgio Armani;age
Many women my age have known the experience of giving up crucial parts of themselves to please the man they love.;Joyce Maynard;age
American Idol transcends age, gender, ethnicity, everything.;Carrie Underwood;age
You get to a certain age and you can't judge yourself on your dad or your parents.;Ellie Goulding;age
I'd like to look like Madonna when I'm her age. I also look at athletes and love their bodies. I've always wanted to be muscly, not skinny. A lot of women yo-yo around, but I'm always aware if I'm getting a bit out of shape. I never look at the scales but I can just tell. It goes on my tum and bum.;Ellie Goulding;age
I could always sing, from a really young age, but my voice was really weird. I used to make my mum turn up the radio every day in our house. She was well into music so I got that from her.;Ellie Goulding;age
I think women get caught up too much in having a plan - 'I'm going to get married at this age I'm going to have a kid at this age' - and then they just try to find a guy who will fit into that picture. I don't want my life to be based on that.;Julia Stiles;age
I was always concerned with writing to my age at a particular moment. That was the way I would keep faith with the audience that supported me as I went along.;Bruce Springsteen;age
Experts tell us that 90% of all brain development occurs by the age of five. If we don't begin thinking about education in the early years, our children are at risk of falling behind by the time they start Kindergarten.;Robert. L. Ehrlich;age
When I was seventeen, I worked as a counsellor at a co-ed sleep-away camp for eight weeks. I loved it but it could be harrowing - it was far too much responsibility for someone my age.;Harlan Coben;age
Music has always been my protection against the world, from a very young age. I feel safe inside of a jam.;Trey Anastasio;age
We are the children of a technological age. We have found streamlined ways of doing much of our routine work. Printing is no longer the only way of reproducing books. Reading them, however, has not changed.;Lawrence Clark Powell;age
Religion is the best antidote to the individualism of the consumer age. The idea that society can do without it flies in the face of history and, now, evolutionary biology.;Jonathan Sacks;age
Religiosity turns out to be the best indicator of civic involvement: it's more accurate than education, age, income, gender or race.;Jonathan Sacks;age
The year I was born, 1956, was the peak year for babies being born, and there are more people essentially our age than anybody else. We could crush these new generations if we decided too.;Tom Hanks;age
Adulthood is the ever-shrinking period between childhood and old age. It is the apparent aim of modern industrial societies to reduce this period to a minimum.;Thomas Szasz;age
I was born at the age of twelve on a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer lot.;Edward Koch;age
We live in an age of instant knowledge. And there's almost a sense of entitlement to that.;J. J. Abrams;age
It's the golden age of French cinema again but it's because Sarkozy had the guts to push through copyright law.;Harvey Weinstein;age
I started in the restaurant business at the age of 19 as a waitress. I loved the atmosphere and the camaraderie of the restaurant business. I loved not having to go to an office. I loved making people happy.;Anne Burrell;age
My view is pensioners don't have the one option that people of working age have. They can't really increase their income, because they are no longer able to work.;Iain Duncan Smith;age
Work is transformative. It gives you a greater chance of a greater income. You can affect your life while you're of working age, so you have scope and opportunity. Pensioners do not.;Iain Duncan Smith;age
I think you can't really escape any kind of spiritual education as a child, whether it's New Age or Judaism or Buddhism or whatever it is. You can't escape it, even if you completely disagree with it, you still have it as a foundation that you base things off of.;Jack White;age
At my age the only problem is with remembering names. When I call everyone darling, it has damn all to do with passionately adoring them, but I know I'm safe calling them that. Although, of course, I adore them too.;Richard Attenborough;age
What I really tried to do with Helen was make her show this sad side of her. She was married off at 16, was so young and living in this castle that can't leave because of how she looks, and married to a man she hates and three times her age.;Diane Kruger;age
I never took guitar lessons. I took classical piano lessons from the age of six when we lived in Holland. And when we moved to America, it was just the typical thing except I was really good at it so was my brother.;Eddie Van Halen;age
I never took guitar lessons. I took classical piano lessons from the age of six when we lived in Holland.;Eddie Van Halen;age
When I write about a 15-year old, I jump, I return to the days when I was that age. It's like a time machine. I can remember everything. I can feel the wind. I can smell the air. Very actually. Very vividly.;Haruki Murakami;age
We live in an age, in an era where there is so much negativity, there is so much violence in the world, there is so much unrest and people are at war, that I wanted to promote the word love and red signifies love.;Elton John;age
I'm 20 years old. I like to party as much as anyone my age. Going clubbing is my way of relaxing or releasing a lot of stress. I don't feel that I should have to justify that part of my life. I don't know that I'm necessarily an addict.;Lindsay Lohan;age
I am happy being able to play roles with people my age because once you do something really mature there is no turning back.;Lindsay Lohan;age
Compared to a lot of actresses my age, I'm actually overweight.;Lindsay Lohan;age
This is what I asked for, and in this day and age that's what actually goes on. But what hurts me the most is that I work just as hard as any other actress around my age, like Scarlett Johansson, but I just don't get the opportunities that they get because people are so distracted by the mess that I created in my life.;Lindsay Lohan;age
At a young age, I was interested in comic books, which was really how I learnt to read. The name Cage came from a comic book character called Power Man.;Nicolas Cage;age
There is a certain age at which a child looks at you in all earnestness and delivers a long, pleased speech in all the true inflections of spoken English, but with not one recognizable syllable.;Annie Dillard;age
I can't wait to be that age and hanging out with a bunch of people hanging out all day playing golf and going to the beach, all my own age. We'd be laughing and having a good time and getting loopy on our prescription drugs. Driving golf carts around. I can't wait.;Cameron Diaz;age
I would love a family. I'm at the age where the wish for a child gets stronger. But who knows.;Cameron Diaz;age
I love physical kinds of comedy and getting down and dirty and doing stunts. When I was growing up, I was always getting into fights with guys and usually punching out boys my age because I was a lot bigger and tougher. So I'm naturally accustomed to putting myself into the headspace of a girl who can take care of herself.;Cameron Diaz;age
Love, with very young people, is a heartless business. We drink at that age from thirst, or to get drunk it is only later in life that we occupy ourselves with the individuality of our wine.;Isak Dinesen;age
Age for me is just a number.;Haile Gebrselassie;age
You hit a certain age and - especially because of TV - the young cooks coming up say, 'You're a sellout, because you're doing something other than what you should be doing.' 'Top Chef' is a double-edged sword for me: There's a whole group of people who will not come to the restaurants because they assume I'm not in them anymore, all I do is TV.;Tom Colicchio;age
Some of your teachers are actually closer in age to you than you think.;Maya Lin;age
From an early age I didn't buy into the value systems of working hard in a nine-to-five job. I thought creativity, friendship and loyalty and pushing the boundaries of what was acceptable was much more interesting.;Adam Clayton;age
I didn't have any success in show business until I was 30 to 31 years of age.;Adam Carolla;age
I hate the idea that you shouldn't wear something just because you're a certain age.;Miuccia Prada;age
I am firmly of the opinion that women who make a lot of effort to hang onto their looks in middle age (unless they are beauties, entertainers or prostitutes) are rather sad, as one should surely have something more substantial to recommend one by this time, such as kindness or cleverness.;Julie Burchill;age
As a precocious teen I dreamed of being Graham Greene. Well, as it turned out, I never wrote a great novel, sadly, and I never converted to Catholicism, happily, but I did do one thing he did. That is, in middle age I moved to a seaside town and got into a right barney with the local powers-that-be.;Julie Burchill;age
Age should not have its face lifted, but it should rather teach the world to admire wrinkles as the etchings of experience and the firm line of character.;Clarence Day;age
Age is only a number, a cipher for the records. A man can't retire his experience. He must use it. Experience achieves more with less energy and time.;Bernard Baruch;age
To me, old age is always fifteen years older than I am.;Bernard Baruch;age
I wear clothes that most people in the Midwest would probably deem inappropriate at my age. And I rock a bikini all summer long. I know that it's not normal, but I just don't care. I live once.;Liz Phair;age
I've lost touch with a lot of that boutique-type music just because of my age, and raising my son and the multiple jobs I have at this point.;Liz Phair;age
There's no way to approach anything in an objective way. We're completely subjective our view of the world is completely controlled by who we are as human beings, as men or women, by our age, our history, our profession, by the state of the world.;Charlie Kaufman;age
Age is not measured by years. Nature does not equally distribute energy. Some people are born old and tired while others are going strong at seventy.;Dorothy Thompson;age
Maybe it is something to do with age, but I have become fonder of poetry than of prose.;Aung San Suu Kyi;age
When I was younger, my whole sense of self-worth was based on whether or not I was working, which was awful. And I had a baby at 20 years old, so it wasn't just about me. At around the age of 30 there was a stretch where I wasn't working - certainly not on anything I liked, anyway - and I started to do other things.;Kiefer Sutherland;age
I grew up on the golden age of children's TV.;Edward Norton;age
I do wish I could tell you my age but it's impossible. It keeps changing all the time.;Greer Garson;age
Pretend to be dumb, that's the only way to reach old age.;Friedrich Durrenmatt;age
The excitement of learning separates youth from old age. As long as you're learning you're not old.;Rosalyn S. Yalow;age
The history of my life must begin by the earliest circumstance which my memory can evoke it will therefore commence when I had attained the age of eight years and four months.;Giacomo Casanova;age
We are in an electronic technology age now and it's about time we put away the old stuff.;Monica Edwards;age
At the age of 20 I bought a used Fiat 127. This was the only one I could afford!;Carlos Ghosn;age
At my age, I don't think anyone is untouched by cancer.;Bryan Cranston;age
We try, we fail, we posture, we aspire, we pontificate - and then we age, shrink, die, and vanish.;George Saunders;age
My habit would have been to veer towards the dark - to prove I was something edgy, or maybe to prove that I was cognisant of the dark side. Now, with age and confidence, I can say, yeah, that's true, but I am cognisant of the fact that people can do things well. And can be more loving than you expect.;George Saunders;age
It is not possible to live in this age if you don't have a sense of many contradictory forces.;Rem Koolhaas;age
I'm very accepting with my age. It's like notches on your belt: experience, wisdom, and a different kind of beauty. There comes a day when you've become comfortable in your skin.;Zoe Saldana;age
You need some insecurity if you're an actor. It keeps the pot boiling. I haven't yet started to think about retiring. I was shocked when I heard about Paul Newman retiring at age 82. Most actors just fade away like old soldiers.;Al Pacino;age
It's hard for women at my age in Hollywood, but I'm not discouraged.;Jane Fonda;age
We're still living with the old paradigm of age as an arch. That's the old metaphor: You're born, you peak at midlife and decline into decrepitude.;Jane Fonda;age
We can no longer waste time and money. Every day, more than 2,000 girls in America, age 15-19, give birth - in the wealthiest, most educated nation in the world! Neither you nor I should accept this statistic.;Jane Fonda;age
The reality is sobering: in the United States one in three girls will become pregnant before age 20, totaling more than 750,000 girls per year.;Jane Fonda;age
I am hoping for peaceful transition into a new age. Obama has already played a great role in initiating us into that vision. If he were to be harmed in any way, it would spawn the birth of a million Obamas.;Saul Williams;age
I definitely don't look my age. So I actively look for roles that will help people change their perception of me.;Elijah Wood;age
The age thing really bugs me. Do people have more of a right to not like what I say because I'm 19?;Fiona Apple;age
There are a lot of downsides to being male. We age faster and die younger. But give us this: we're lifetime baby-making machines. Women's reproductive abilities start to wane when they're as young as 35. Men? We're good to go pretty much till we're dead.;Jeffrey Kluger;age
Older fatherhood isn't all bad: testosterone rates drop about 1% per year as men age, making them less reactive and more patient, and a professionally established middle-aged man is likely to have more time and money to devote to his kids than a twenty-something who's just getting started.;Jeffrey Kluger;age
Credit or debit cards, for starters, are nothing short of shoppers' Novocain. Even in the age of digital purchases and virtual money, we still attach a special value to dirty paper with pictures of presidents on it. Handing some of that to a cashier simply hurts more than handing over a little sliver of plastic.;Jeffrey Kluger;age
When it comes to raising civilized kids there are no hard rules, but there are two things on which most parents agree: Boys are generally wilder than girls, and adolescents are wilder than kids of any other age. If you've got an adolescent boy, you're in the sweet spot for trouble.;Jeffrey Kluger;age
It seems to me there is a change in what audiences want to see. I can only hope that's correct, because there's an awful lot of people of my age around now and we outnumber the others.;Maggie Smith;age
A truly great book should be read in youth, again in maturity and once more in old age, as a fine building should be seen by morning light, at noon and by moonlight.;Robertson Davies;age
In Hollywood, you play a mom, and the next thing you know, you're on 'The Golden Girls.' They age you so fast.;Gabrielle Union;age
A great age of literature is perhaps always a great age of translations.;Ezra Pound;age
I can't get my knickers in a twist about my age and ageing in an industry that caters to the ids of 14-year-olds.;Vera Farmiga;age
I was living on the wrong side of the tracks in Evanston, Illinois, in a home for boys. We had these Jackson 5 records. I really related to their voices - they were about my age, but they were doing it.;Eddie Vedder;age
By age seven, I used to comb my hair for performances, just pull my hair up into a bun. Granted, it wasn't a very intricate hairstyle. Still, to be that responsible and disciplined at age seven is unusual.;Janet Jackson;age
It begins and ends with money. It's absurd in this day and age when we need so much money for education, health, for people, that a $100 million dollars can be spent on a film. It's obscene.;Kathleen Turner;age
I am at that age when you panic at the slightest thing.;Rupert Everett;age
Being gay and being a woman has one big thing in common, which is that we both become invisible after the age of 42. Who wants a gay 50-year-old? No one, let me tell you.;Rupert Everett;age
I began to speak well at a very advanced age - 15, 16, 17 years old. It was psychological: the trauma of war, my family and growing up on my own. I was more or less a street kid.;Roberto Cavalli;age
We Jews have a special attachment to the Book. The study of page after page in tomes yellowing with age was obligatory.;Theodore Bikel;age
Having come to live in this age is as though one were to have entered another country. Learn its language or risk being left out.;Theodore Bikel;age
I don't want to look at other people my age in leather. Why would I put it on?;George Michael;age
I believe that the fight against crime starts in the home. Parents must take responsibility for their children and show them love and guidance from an early age so they learn to respect the rights of others.;Blanche Lincoln;age
At an early age, I started my own paper route. Once I saw how you could service people and do a good job and get paid for it, I just wanted to be the best I could be in whatever I did.;Puff Daddy;age
Middle age: when you begin to exchange your emotions for symptoms.;Irvin S. Cobb;age
Brain power improves by brain use, just as our bodily strength grows with exercise. And there is no doubt that a large proportion of the female population, from school days to late middle age, now have very complicated lives indeed.;A. N. Wilson;age
I began to understand my sensations, to know what I wanted, at around the age of forty - but only vaguely.;Camille Pissarro;age
I grew up on a farm in a small town where you do or say one thing and everybody knows about it. You see it happen, there's always the town gossip - 'Oh did you hear about so and so, or did you hear what went on in this household?' So I learned at a very young age just to keep my mouth shut.;Garrett Hedlund;age
If you love somebody, you love them. My parents had a 25-year age gap between them and my mum was the breadwinner, my dad the house husband. I'm a strong believer that a good relationship can work, whatever the situation.;Katherine Jenkins;age
The Border Ballads, for instance, and the Robin Hood Ballads, clearly suppose a state of society which is nothing but a very circumscribed and not very important heroic age.;Lascelles Abercrombie;age
By the age of 9 or 10, I knew that I had to cut my own cloth and make my own way.;John le Carre;age
When you're my age and you see a story, you better go for it pretty quickly. I'd just like to get a few more novels under my belt.;John le Carre;age
Catholics and evangelicals need to remain allied, and in solidarity, against the increasingly aggressive secularism of our age.;Gary Bauer;age
I don't know whether it's age or maturity, but I certainly find myself committed more and more to the looser forms of Western democracy at any price.;John le Carre;age
Losing both parents at a young age gave me a sense that you can't really control life - so you'd better live it while it's here. I stopped believing in a storybook existence a long time ago. All you can do is push in a direction and see what comes of it.;Jon Hamm;age
Old age is not a disease - it is strength and survivorship, triumph over all kinds of vicissitudes and disappointments, trials and illnesses.;Maggie Kuhn;age
I was a very sickly kid. While I was in the hospital at age 7, my Dad brought me a stack of comic books to keep me occupied. I was hooked.;Len Wein;age
Study until twenty-five, investigation until forty, profession until sixty, at which age I would have him retired on a double allowance.;Thomas Moore;age
In the digital age of 'overnight' success stories such as Facebook, the hard slog is easily overlooked.;James Dyson;age
The greatest writers of this age... are aware of the mystery of our existence.;J. B. Priestley;age
The chief role of the universities is to prolong adolescence into middle age, at which point early retirement ensures that we lack the means or the will to enforce significant change.;J. G. Ballard;age
My grandparents got married at a very young age, and a lot of what I think about marriage is based on their relationship. I watched them over the years and saw how they dealt with everything together, as a team.;Kyle Chandler;age
My grandparents got married at a very young age, and a lot of what I think about marriage is based on their relationship.;Kyle Chandler;age
At my age it is unseemly to be pessimistic.;Naguib Mahfouz;age
I don't know why people are so obsessed with age anyway. I mean, 90 is the new 70 70 is the new 50 and 50 is the new 40 so the whole act-your-age thing? Only up to a point.;Joan Collins;age
I don't look my age, I don't feel my age and I don't act my age. To me age is just a number.;Joan Collins;age
I believe that parents need to make nutrition education a priority in their home environment. It's crucial for good health and longevity to instill in your children sound eating habits from an early age.;Cat Cora;age
Most poetry in the modern age has retreated to the private sphere, turning its back on the political realm.;Terry Eagleton;age
We incorporated new tastes and flavors into our kids' diets from a very early age, which helped to develop their palates and prevented them from becoming picky eaters. We don't buy junk food and give them options of fresh fruit, yogurt, raw almonds, or dried whole grain cereals for snack time.;Cat Cora;age
Filth and old age, I'm sure you will agree, are powerful wardens upon chastity.;Geoffrey Chaucer;age
It has been claimed at times that our modern age of technology facilitates dictatorship.;Henry A. Wallace;age
Working on the 'Ice Age' movies, I'm really proud to be in them.;Seann William Scott;age
No Congress ever has seen fit to amend the Constitution to address any issue related to marriage. No Constitutional Amendment was needed to ban polygamy or bigamy, nor was a Constitutional Amendment needed to set a uniform age of majority to ban child marriages.;Judy Biggert;age
We're taught at such a young age that you can always be better and that you're never perfect and that you're never good enough.;Shawn Johnson;age
The young people have MTV and rock and roll. Why would they go to read poetry? Poetry belongs to the Stone Age. It awakens in us perceptions that go back to those times.;Robert Morgan;age
Study is the bane of childhood, the oil of youth, the indulgence of adulthood, and a restorative in old age.;Walter Savage Landor;age
Because of my age and because there's more work on the small screen. What it's missing in quality it makes up for in quantity. From an actor's selfish point of view.;Cesar Romero;age
Old age is an insult. It's like being smacked.;Lawrence Durrell;age
Age puzzles me. I thought it was a quiet time. My seventies were interesting and fairly serene, but my eighties are passionate. I grow more intense as I age.;Florida Scott-Maxwell;age
One of the great challenges of our age, in which the tools of our productivity are also the tools of our leisure, is to figure out how to make more useful those moments of procrastination when we're idling in front of our computer screens.;Joshua Foer;age
I happen to be interested in watching a face age. I like faces of women aging so it makes me personally quite sad. That's a beautiful gift from God. If people don't want to see that anymore then I won't be in anymore movies.;Debra Winger;age
Never say never, but the thought of electively cutting oneself is beyond my grasp, and I also object to it politically. Denying the lines on our faces makes a comment about age and wisdom I don't care to make.;Debra Winger;age
People pay to see movies with women looking beautiful, but I think there will be a place for me to play women looking my own age.;Debra Winger;age
There's a small club of women who are willing to age.;Debra Winger;age
I hope to find the roles that are age appropriate but not yearning to be younger, or parenting ad nauseam.;Debra Winger;age
I try to write lyrics so that they won't age, which sort of leaves you with the big subjects like death and love and sex and violence.;Florence Welch;age
In the modern media age we are rarely surprised by what we see. Whether it's on television or film or in the theatre, everything is so advertised, so trailed, that most entertainment is merely what you thought it was going to be like.;Rowan Atkinson;age
Your 40s are a major trough. About the age of 50, feelings of satisfaction begin to rebound and keep rising into your 50s, 60s and 70s, with health being a major factor.;Jane Pauley;age
I came back to work when my children were two months old. At that early age, they seem to have little awareness of anybody but their Raggedy Ann dolls, so it wasn't a matter of them missing me. I was missing them.;Jane Pauley;age
Being successful at a very young age gave me the confidence and the capability to try out other things.;Joshua Lederberg;age
About the time I turned 50, I experienced the profound biological change that often accompanies women at that age. Also, I put two kids in college and lost both of my parents, so I'm no longer somebody's daughter.;Jane Pauley;age
I feel more mature than most people my age.;Leighton Meester;age
Age does not bring you wisdom, age brings you wrinkles.;Estelle Getty;age
Maybe I'll be a feminist in my old age.;Bjork;age
I feel the 21st century is another new age. Not only can we collaborate again with nature, but we have to. It's an emergency.;Bjork;age
You can fake your age or mask it, but the passion that moves the characters has to be real.;Victoria Abril;age
I think that clearly it has an influence, to be coming of age during the punk rock era, to come from a difficult and sporadically violent background, to have been in and out of such chaos, I think it actually helps. But I don't know for sure.;Craig Ferguson;age
I'd date someone younger or older age doesn't matter to me. Or looks, really - it's all about maturity.;Leona Lewis;age
Try to keep your soul young and quivering right up to old age.;George Sand;age
I wanted to be a forest ranger or a coal man. At a very early age, I knew I didn't want to do what my dad did, which was work in an office.;Harrison Ford;age
Parenting is an impossible job at any age.;Harrison Ford;age
Sally Field looks amazing in general, never mind her age! She's a phenomenally talented actress and has had a career spanning so many decades.;Alison Sweeney;age
I've had two romances since moving to Las Vegas. One was with somebody 12 years older than me, and the other was the same age, and neither worked out. I know people still think of me as one of Hugh Hefner's girlfriends, and he of course was much older than me, but that was a whole different lifestyle and a different kind of dating.;Holly Madison;age
From age 16, I lived and breathed wine. I read every magazine and book about wine.;Gary Vaynerchuk;age
IQ is a commodity, data is a commodity. I'm far more interested in watching people interact at a restaurant with their smartphone. We can all read 'Tech Crunch,' 'Ad Age.' I would rather be living in the trenches. I would rather be going to Whole Foods in Columbus Circle to watch people shop with their smartphones.;Gary Vaynerchuk;age
Genius worship is the inevitable sign of an uncreative age.;Clive Bell;age
I appreciate and enjoy my age.;Nikki Giovanni;age
I've been going through photos of my mother, looking back on her life and trying to put it into context. Very few people age gracefully enough to be photographed through their aging.;Jamie Lee Curtis;age
I am rediscovering the whole sexual dimension of life at the age of 86, really. And that also means discovering the feminine. So the whole of this dimension, which I had been seeking for a very long time, is now sort of opening itself up to me.;Bede Griffiths;age
I think all writers of my age who are brought up on films probably by the age of 16 have seen many more films than they have read classics of literature. We can't help but be influenced by film. Film has got some great tricks that it's taught writers.;David Mitchell;age
Some broad themes brought me where I am today. At a very young age, my hobby became thinking and finding connections.;Dean Kamen;age
I think you have to be a little bit strict. You can't be friend and their parent in a lot of situations, especially in this day and age where it's so dangerous for kids. So there's a bit of sternness, I guess, in the way I raise my kids.;Tim McGraw;age
In the 1970s and 1980s there was so little decent fiction for young people, but we're now in a golden age that shows no sign of fading. Philip Pullman, J. K. Rowling, Lemony Snicket are only three of the best known among a good number of equals.;David Mitchell;age
I want to sell to people my own age, because that's the way I write songs.;John Mellencamp;age
You get to a certain age and you just want to prove that you can still rock - that you've still got it.;Jarvis Cocker;age
I always thought that I might retire from any form of sexuality by the age of 40 and just become a dignified older person.;Jarvis Cocker;age
It's only at this age that I can say the word 'art' without flinching.;Mira Nair;age
Well, once you've resigned yourself to the fact that you are the more mature pop performer and you're past the age you ever thought you would do it, you might as well do it as long as you can. As long as I can still lift a microphone, then I'll do it, you know.;Jarvis Cocker;age
I hope to have one more boxing match at the age of 55. Given that demographic at the age of 55 to 65, you've got to make a statement with your life. Otherwise, you are just existing.;George Foreman;age
I think it's hard, the fact that there's a certain age that we can't have kids anymore.;Courteney Cox;age
While I had often said that I wanted to die in bed, what I really meant was that in my old age I wanted to be stepped on by an elephant while making love.;Roger Zelazny;age
I basically started playing violin at the age of six. That lasted about three years because my previous teacher died and the second teacher didn't really know how to successfully get me going.;Miroslav Vitous;age
Age acquires no value save through thought and discipline.;James Truslow Adams;age
I've had to be a man since I was 12 or 13. I had a job. And I was playing the piano for people twice my age. Handling responsibility is what makes a man a man.;Jamie Foxx;age
Old age isn't so bad when you consider the alternative.;Maurice Chevalier;age
Up until age 40, most men are just not as mature as women. So, it makes sense that a lot of women date up in age a bit.;Patti Stanger;age
Think back to yourself at age 18. I know I was mighty different than the Patti I am today. As we grow up, we grow out of our haircuts, our apartments and - often times - our romantic decisions.;Patti Stanger;age
I was well motivated. What I wanted to do was work for myself. I had twenty two jobs before I started my business at the age of twenty three and I didn't want one more boss telling me what to do. So I was motivated simply because I didn't want a boss.;Barbara Corcoran;age
Regardless of age, regardless of position, regardless of the business we happen to be in, all of us need to understand the importance of branding. We are CEOs of our own companies: Me, Inc. To be in business today, our most important job is to be head marketer for the brand called You.;Tom Peters;age
An age which is incapable of poetry is incapable of any kind of literature except the cleverness of a decadence.;Raymond Chandler;age
I've always felt that sexuality is a really slippery thing. In this day and age, it tends to get categorized and labeled, and I think labels are for food. Canned food.;Michael Stipe;age
There must be a law against forcing children to perform at an early age. Children should have a wonderful childhood. They should not be given too much responsibility.;Maria Callas;age
Each age tries to form its own conception of the past. Each age writes the history of the past anew with reference to the conditions uppermost in its own time.;Frederick Jackson Turner;age

I don't mind my age.;Heather Mills;age
Despite what anti-aging ads say, growing older can be better. I feel better in my skin, 100 percent. You have greater effects of gravity, but the better sense of yourself you have is something I wouldn't trade. Women who lie about their age - 'why?';Demi Moore;age

I'm never overawed by a situation and I think that's because I've always looked several years older than I am. So because people were treating me like I was 40 when I was 29, I've always felt in control of a situation. People used to say, when you're 32, you'll look 32. I'm still waiting for that moment, where my age catches up with my appearance.;Chris O'Dowd;age
I am 54 and age is slowly writing itself on my face.;Arthur Smith;age

Why did this happen? Look where that led? You see the shape of things.;Ron Perlman;age
I've always been intrigued by color and by interesting hair. I was one of those weird little girls doing my own hair at the age of 9. I was, like, getting weird gels and new brushes and cornrow holders. I would tweak and perm at the age of 13.;Nicki Minaj;age

I'm so secluded. Very alone.;Yves Saint Laurent;alone

The White House alone cannot hold its opponents accountable.;Paul Weyrich;alone
Largely this is a class thing - writers tend to be cosseted little middle-class kiddies who think that the world owes them a royalty cheque.

To create architecture is to put in order. Put what in order? Function and objects.;Le Corbusier;architecture

I'm drawn to furniture design as complete architecture on a minor scale.;Brad Pitt;architecture

I strive for an architecture from which nothing can be taken away.;Helmut Jahn;architecture

The speed of change makes you wonder what will become of architecture.;Tadao Ando;architecture
Without this spirit, Modernist architecture cannot fully exist. Since there is often a mismatch between the logic and the spirit of Modernism, I use architecture to reconcile the two.;Tadao Ando;architecture

Until the Eighties, Oslo was a rather boring town, but it's changed a lot, and is now much more cosmopolitan.

But after the time there I'd had it with fashion again, so I left to go to architecture school in a summer course at Harvard, which didn't last very long.;Stephen Sprouse;architecture

I like things that are kind of eclectic, when one thing doesn't go with another. That's why I love Rome. The town itself is that way.

That's my style, and that's what my work is about.;Giambattista Valli;architecture
I feel however, that we architects have a special duty and mission... (to contribute) to the socio-cultural development of architecture and urban planning.;Kenzo Tange;architecture

Music is your own experience, your own thoughts, your wisdom. If you don't live it, it won't come out of your horn. They teach you there's a boundary line to music. But, man, there's no boundary line to art.;Charlie Parker;art
My age and health will never allow me to realize the dream of art I've been pursuing all my life.;Paul Cezanne;art
Don't be an art critic. Paint. There lies salvation.;Paul Cezanne;art
Film editing is now something almost everyone can do at a simple level and enjoy it, but to take it to a higher level requires the same dedication and persistence that any art form does.;Walter Murch;art
Love and business and family and religion and art and patriotism are nothing but shadows of words when a man's starving!;O. Henry;art
It ought to be illegal for an artist to marry. If the artist must marry let him find someone more interested in art, or his art, or the artist part of him, than in him. After which let them take tea together three times a week.;Ezra Pound;art
It is not in life, but in art that self-fulfillment is to be found.;Wilson Mizner;art
Art lies by its own artifice.;Ovid;art
Art has a double face, of expression and illusion, just like science has a double face: the reality of error and the phantom of truth.;Publilius Syrus;art
Art and works of art do not make an artist sense and enthusiasm and instinct do.;Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel;art
You can't but know that if you can capture the emotions of the audience as well as their minds, the play will work better, because it's a narrative art form.;Tom Stoppard;art
Teachers believe they have a gift for giving it drives them with the same irrepressible drive that drives others to create a work of art or a market or a building.;A. Bartlett Giamatti;art
The art challenges the technology, and the technology inspires the art.;John Lasseter;art
To say the word Romanticism is to say modern art - that is, intimacy, spirituality, color, aspiration towards the infinite, expressed by every means available to the arts.;Charles Baudelaire;art
What strikes me is the fact that in our society, art has become something which is only related to objects, and not to individuals, or to life.;Michel Foucault;art
Art is so subjective, and people can react however they want.;Jennifer Aniston;art
I'm free. I just do what I want, say what I want, say how I feel, and I don't try to hurt nobody. I just try to make sure that I don't compromise my art in any kind of way, and I think people respect that.;Erykah Badu;art
Rumors sound of galleries asking artists for upsized art and more of it. I've heard of photographers asked to print larger to increase the wall power and salability of their work. Everything winds up set to maximum in order to feed the beast.;Jerry Saltz;art
To engage with art, we have to be willing to be wrong, venture outside our psychic comfort zones, suspend disbelief, and remember that art explores and alters consciousness simultaneously.;Jerry Saltz;art
Summer is a great time to visit art museums, which offer the refreshing rinse of swimming pools - only instead of cool water, you immerse yourself in art.;Jerry Saltz;art
I can't bear art that you can walk round and admire. A book should be either a bandit or a rebel or a man in the crowd.;David Herbert Lawrence;art
Since obscenity is the truth of our passion today, it is the only stuff of art - or almost the only stuff.;David Herbert Lawrence;art
The essential function of art is moral. But a passionate, implicit morality, not didactic. A morality which changes the blood, rather than the mind.;David Herbert Lawrence;art
I am more a friend of art than a producer of painting.;Paul Cezanne;art
You say a new era in art is preparing you sensed it coming continue your studies without weakening. God will do the rest.;Paul Cezanne;art
I have nothing to hide in art. The initial force alone can bring anyone to the end he must attain.;Paul Cezanne;art
Is art really the priesthood that demands the pure in heart who belong to it wholly?;Paul Cezanne;art
A frenzied passion for art is a canker that devours everything else.;Charles Baudelaire;art
Evil is done without effort, naturally, it is the working of fate good is always the product of an art.;Charles Baudelaire;art
I didn't grow up thinking of movies as film, or art, but as movies, something to do on a Saturday afternoon.;Sydney Pollack;art
The art of living is the art of knowing how to believe lies.;Cesare Pavese;art
Let's talk of a system that transforms all the social organisms into a work of art, in which the entire process of work is included... something in which the principle of production and consumption takes on a form of quality. It's a Gigantic project.;Joseph Beuys;art
Any authentic work of art must start an argument between the artist and his audience.;Rebecca West;art
History repeats itself, but the special call of an art which has passed away is never reproduced. It is as utterly gone out of the world as the song of a destroyed wild bird.;Joseph Conrad;art
One of the most amazing things about mathematics is the people who do math aren't usually interested in application, because mathematics itself is truly a beautiful art form. It's structures and patterns, and that's what we love, and that's what we get off on.;Danica McKellar;art
A rose is the visible result of an infinitude of complicated goings on in the bosom of the earth and in the air above, and similarly a work of art is the product of strange activities in the human mind.;Clive Bell;art
It was Public Art, defined as art that is purchased by experts who are not spending their own personal money.;Dave Barry;art
Art is not necessary at all. All that is necessary to make this world a better place to live in is to love - to love as Christ loved, as Buddha loved.;Isadora Duncan;art
Advertising is fundamentally persuasion and persuasion happens to be not a science, but an art.;William Bernbach;art
I was doing these performance art pop music pieces in the city. And they were a bit on the eccentric side I suppose. So people started to call me Gaga after the Queen song 'Radio Gaga.';Lady Gaga;art
Medicine is not only a science it is also an art. It does not consist of compounding pills and plasters it deals with the very processes of life, which must be understood before they may be guided.;Paracelsus;art
I would no more quarrel with a man because of his religion than I would because of his art.;Mary Baker Eddy;art
So long as the system of competition in the production and exchange of the means of life goes on, the degradation of the arts will go on and if that system is to last for ever, then art is doomed, and will surely die that is to say, civilization will die.;William Morris;art
Poor Georgia O'Keeffe. Death didn't soften the opinions of the art world toward her paintings.;Jerry Saltz;art
I've always said that an art critic can put aside politics around art.;Jerry Saltz;art
Megacollectors suppose they can enter art history by spending astronomical amounts.;Jerry Saltz;art
The art gods cooked up something special for James Ensor.;Jerry Saltz;art
All art comes from other art, and all immigrants come from other places.;Jerry Saltz;art
When art wins, everyone wins.;Jerry Saltz;art
I have a soft spot for art that, in terms of subject matter and material, is in bad taste.;Jerry Saltz;art
Art is changing. Again. Here. Now. Opportunities to witness this are rare, so attend and observe.;Jerry Saltz;art
Art is good, bad, boring, ugly, useful to us or not.;Jerry Saltz;art
Recessions are hard on people, but they are not hard on art.;Jerry Saltz;art
I like that the art world isn't regulated.;Jerry Saltz;art
The art world is molting - some would say melting. Galleries are closing museums are scaling back.;Jerry Saltz;art
Almost all institutions own a lot more art than they can ever show, much of it revealing for its timeliness, genius, or sheer weirdness.;Jerry Saltz;art
The forties, seventies, and the nineties, when money was scarce, were great periods, when the art world retracted but it was also reborn.;Jerry Saltz;art
Robert Rauschenberg was not a giant of American art he was the giant. No American created so many aesthetic openings for so many artists.;Jerry Saltz;art
The Met is not only the finest encyclopedic museum of art in the United States it is arguably the finest anywhere.;Jerry Saltz;art
Money is something that can be measured art is not. It's all subjective.;Jerry Saltz;art
Contrary to popular opinion, things don't go stale particularly fast in the art world.;Jerry Saltz;art
Art usually only makes the news in America when the subject is money.;Jerry Saltz;art
I hate art auctions.;Jerry Saltz;art
The price of a work of art has nothing to do with what the work of art is, can do, or is worth on an existential, alchemical level.;Jerry Saltz;art
To me, nothing in the art world is neutral. The idea of 'disinterest' strikes me as boring, dishonest, dubious, and uninteresting.;Jerry Saltz;art
The art world is an all-volunteer force. No one has to be here if he or she doesn't want to be, and we should be associating with anyone we want to.;Jerry Saltz;art
Wolfgang Tillman's stunning large-scale pictures, being shown for the first time, were so offhand I failed to see them as art.;Jerry Saltz;art
Galleries began growing in both number and size in the late seventies, when artists who worked in lofts wanted to exhibit their work in spaces similar to the ones the art was made in.;Jerry Saltz;art
There's something pleasing about large, well-lit spaces. I love that dealers are willing to take massive chances in order to give this much room to their artists. Most of all, I love that more galleries showing more art gives more artists a shot.;Jerry Saltz;art
First let me report that the art in the Barnes Collection has never looked better. My trips to the old Barnes were always amazing, but except on the sunniest days, you could barely see the art. The building always felt pushed beyond its capacity.;Jerry Saltz;art
Not to say people shouldn't get rich from art. I adore the alchemy wherein artists who cast a complex spell make rich people give them their money. (Just writing it makes me cackle.) But too many artists have been making money without magic.;Jerry Saltz;art
These days, newish art can be priced between $10,000 and $25,000. When I tell artists that a new painting by a newish artist should go for around $1,200, they look at me like I'm a flesh-eating virus.;Jerry Saltz;art
In art, scandal is a false narrative, a smoke screen that camouflages rather than reveals. When we don't know what we're seeing, we overreact.;Jerry Saltz;art
Damien Hirst is the Elvis of the English art world, its ayatollah, deliverer, and big-thinking entrepreneurial potty-mouthed prophet and front man. Hirst synthesizes punk, Pop Art, Jeff Koons, Marcel Duchamp, Francis Bacon, and Catholicism.;Jerry Saltz;art
Anyone who relishes art should love the extraordinary diversity and psychic magic of our art galleries. There's likely more combined square footage for the showing of art on one New York block - West 24th Street between Tenth and Eleventh Avenues - than in all of Amsterdam's or Hamburg's galleries.;Jerry Saltz;art
Yes, 85 percent of the art you see isn't any good. But everyone has a different opinion about which 85 percent is bad. That in turn creates fantastically unstable interplay and argument.;Jerry Saltz;art
Many museums are drawing audiences with art that is ostensibly more entertaining than stuff that just sits and invites contemplation. Interactivity, gizmos, eating, hanging out, things that make noise - all are now the norm, often edging out much else.;Jerry Saltz;art
Imagine it's 1981. You're an artist, in love with art, smitten with art history. You're also a woman, with almost no mentors to look to art history just isn't that into you. Any woman approaching art history in the early eighties was attempting to enter an almost foreign country, a restricted and exclusionary domain that spoke a private language.;Jerry Saltz;art
Willem de Kooning is generally credited for coming out of the painterly gates strong in the forties, revolutionizing art and abstraction and reaching incredible heights by the early fifties, and then tailing off.;Jerry Saltz;art
I also take pleasure in the so-called negative power in Grotjahn's work. That is, I love his paintings for what they are not. Unlike much art of the past decade, Grotjahn isn't simply working from a prescribed checklist of academically acceptable, curator-approved 'isms' and twists.;Jerry Saltz;art
It is not possible to overstate the influence of Paul Cezanne on twentieth-century art. He's the modern Giotto, someone who shattered one kind of picture-making and invented a new one that the world followed.;Jerry Saltz;art
The greatest work of art about New York? The question seems nebulous. The city's magic and majesty are distilled in the photographs of Alfred Stieglitz and Paul Strand.;Jerry Saltz;art
Abstract Expressionism - the first American movement to have a worldwide influence - was remarkably short-lived: It heated up after World War II and was all but done for by 1960 (although visit any art school today and you'll find a would-be Willem de Kooning).;Jerry Saltz;art
My culture-deprived, aspirational mother dragged me once a month from our northern suburb - where the word art never came up - to the Art Institute of Chicago. I hated it.;Jerry Saltz;art
I'm noticing a new approach to art making in recent museum and gallery shows. It flickered into focus at the New Museum's 'Younger Than Jesus' last year and ran through the Whitney Biennial, and I'm seeing it blossom and bear fruit at 'Greater New York,' MoMA P.S. 1's twice-a-decade extravaganza of emerging local talent.;Jerry Saltz;art
Outside museums, in noisy public squares, people look at people. Inside museums, we leave that realm and enter what might be called the group-mind, getting quiet to look at art.;Jerry Saltz;art
It took the Metropolitan Museum of Art nearly 50 years to wake up to Pablo Picasso. It didn't own one of his paintings until 1946, when Gertrude Stein bequeathed that indomitable quasi-Cubistic picture of herself - a portrait of the writer as a sumo Buddha - to the Met, principally because she disliked the Museum of Modern Art.;Jerry Saltz;art
All of Koons's best art - the encased vacuum cleaners, the stainless-steel Rabbit (the late-twentieth century's signature work of Simulationist sculpture), the amazing gleaming Balloon Dog, and the cast-iron re-creation of a Civil War mortar exhibited last month at the Armory - has simultaneously flaunted extreme realism, idealism, and fantasy.;Jerry Saltz;art
Venice is the perfect place for a phase of art to die. No other city on earth embraces entropy quite like this magical floating mall.;Jerry Saltz;art
Appropriation is the idea that ate the art world. Go to any Chelsea gallery or international biennial and you'll find it. It's there in paintings of photographs, photographs of advertising, sculpture with ready-made objects, videos using already-existing film.;Jerry Saltz;art
After its hothouse incubation in the seventies, appropriation breathed important new life into art. This life flowered spectacularly over the decades - even if it's now close to aesthetic kudzu.;Jerry Saltz;art
The New York art world readily proves people wrong. Just when folks say that things stink and flibbertigibbet critics wish the worst on us all because we're not pure enough, good omens appear.;Jerry Saltz;art
Artistic qualities that once seemed undeniable don't seem so now. Sometimes these fluctuations are only fickleness of taste, momentary glitches in an artist's work, or an artist getting ahead of his audience (it took me ten years to catch up to Albert Oehlen). Other times, however, these problems mean there's something wrong with the art.;Jerry Saltz;art
Can space break? I mean the space of art galleries. Over the past 100 years, art galleries have gone from looking like Beaux Arts salons to simple storefronts to industrial lofts to the gleaming giant white cubes of Chelsea with their shiny concrete floors.;Jerry Saltz;art
It's great that New York has large spaces for art. But the enormous immaculate box has become a dated, even oppressive place. Many of these spaces were designed for sprawling installations, large paintings, and the Relational Aesthetics work of the past fifteen years.;Jerry Saltz;art
The giant white cube is now impeding rather than enhancing the rhythms of art. It preprograms a viewer's journey, shifts the emphasis from process to product, and lacks individuality and openness. It's not that art should be seen only in rutty bombed-out environments, but it should seem alive.;Jerry Saltz;art
It's art that pushes against psychological and social expectations, that tries to transform decay into something generative, that is replicative in a baroque way, that isn't about progress, and wants to - as Walt Whitman put it - 'contain multitudes.';Jerry Saltz;art
The last time money left the art world, intrepid types maxed out their credit cards and opened galleries, and a few of them have become the best in the world.;Jerry Saltz;art
Much good art got made while money ruled I like a lot of it, and hardship and poverty aren't virtues. The good news is that, since almost no one will be selling art, artists - especially emerging ones - won't have to think about turning out a consistent style or creating a brand. They'll be able to experiment as much as they want.;Jerry Saltz;art
While a large segment of the art world has obsessed over a tiny number of stars and their prices, an aesthetic shift has been occurring. It's not a movement - movements are more sure of themselves. It's a change of mood or expectation, a desire for art to be more than showy effects, big numbers, and gamesmanship.;Jerry Saltz;art
When money and hype recede from the art world, one thing I won't miss will be what curator Francesco Bonami calls the 'Eventocracy.' All this flashy 'art-fair art' and those highly produced space-eating spectacles and installations wow you for a minute until you move on to the next adrenaline event.;Jerry Saltz;art
A saboteur in the house of art and a comedienne in the house of art theory, Lawler has spent three decades documenting the secret life of art. Functioning as a kind of one-woman CSI unit, she has photographed pictures and objects in collectors' homes, in galleries, on the walls of auction houses, and off the walls, in museum storage.;Jerry Saltz;art
Works of art often last forever, or nearly so. But exhibitions themselves, especially gallery exhibitions, are like flowers they bloom and then they die, then exist only as memories, or pressed in magazines and books.;Jerry Saltz;art
If only we could persuade galleries to observe a fallow period in which, for two months every other year, new and old works of art could be sold in back rooms and all main galleries would be devoted to revisiting shows gone by.;Jerry Saltz;art
A canon is antithetical to everything the New York art world has been about for the past 40 years, during which we went from being the center of the art world to being one of many centers.;Jerry Saltz;art
It took me twenty years to get Steven Parrino's work. From the time I first saw his art, in the mid-eighties, I almost always dismissed it as mannered, Romantic, formulaic, conceptualist-formalist heavy-metal boy-art abstraction.;Jerry Saltz;art
'Untitled' is a time machine that can transport you to 1992, an edgy moment when the art world was crumbling, money was scarce, and artists like Tiravanija were in the nascent stages of combining Happenings, performance art, John Cage, Joseph Beuys, and the do-it-yourself ethos of punk. Meanwhile, a new art world was coming into being.;Jerry Saltz;art
Many art-worlders have an if-you-say-so approach to art: Everyone is so scared of missing out on the next hot artist that it's never clear whether people are liking work because they like it or because other people do. Everyone is keeping up with the Joneses, and there are more Joneses than ever.;Jerry Saltz;art
A sad fact of life lately at the Museum of Modern Art is that when it comes to group shows of contemporary painting from the collection, the bar has been set pretty low.;Jerry Saltz;art
The alchemy of good curating amounts to this: Sometimes, placing one work of art near another makes one plus one equal three. Two artworks arranged alchemically leave each intact, transform both, and create a third thing.;Jerry Saltz;art
Everyone goes to the same exhibitions and the same parties, stays in the same handful of hotels, eats at the same no-star restaurants, and has almost the same opinions. I adore the art world, but this is copycat behavior in a sphere that prides itself on independent thinking.;Jerry Saltz;art
Mission accomplished. The Museum of Modern Art's wide-open, tall-ceilinged, super-reinforced second floor was for all intents and purposes built to accommodate monumental installations and gigantic sculptures, should the need arise. It has arisen.;Jerry Saltz;art
'Summer of Love: Art of the Psychedelic Era,' the Whitney Museum's 40th-anniversary trip down counterculture memory lane, provides moments of buzzy fun, but it'll leave you only comfortably numb. For starters, it may be the whitest, straightest, most conservative show seen in a New York museum since psychedelia was new.;Jerry Saltz;art
Kinkade estimated that one of his paintings hung in every twenty homes in America. Yet the art world unanimously ignores or reviles him. Me included.;Jerry Saltz;art
Those who love him love that he sells the most art they take it as a point of faith that this proves Kinkade is the best. But his fans don't only rely on this supply-and-demand justification. They go back to values.;Jerry Saltz;art
The reason the art world doesn't respond to Kinkade is because none - not one - of his ideas about subject-matter, surface, color, composition, touch, scale, form, or skill is remotely original. They're all cliche and already told.;Jerry Saltz;art
Kinkade's paintings are worthless schmaltz, and the lamestream media that love him are wrong. However, I'd love to see a museum mount a small show of Kinkade's work. I would like the art world and the wider world to argue about him in public, out in the open.;Jerry Saltz;art
Auction houses run a rigged game. They know exactly how many people will be bidding on a work and exactly who they are. In a gallery, works of art need only one person who wants to pay for them.;Jerry Saltz;art
Artschwager's art always involves looking closely at surfaces, questions what an object is, wants to make you forget the name of the thing you're looking at so that it might mushroom in your mind into something that triggers unexpected infinities.;Jerry Saltz;art
Early-twentieth-century abstraction is art's version of Einstein's Theory of Relativity. It's the idea that changed everything everywhere: quickly, decisively, for good.;Jerry Saltz;art
The Metropolitan Museum of Art is unsurpassed at presenting more than 50 centuries of work. I go there constantly, seeing things over and over, better than I've ever seen them before.;Jerry Saltz;art
If the Frieze Art Fair catches on, I imagine at least two great things happening. First, we will once again have a huge art fair in town that isn't too annoying to go to. More importantly, Frieze may finally show New Yorkers that we can cross our own waters for visual culture. That would change everything.;Jerry Saltz;art
Art is for anyone. It just isn't for everyone. Still, over the past decade, its audience has hugely grown, and that's irked those outside the art world, who get irritated at things like incomprehensibility or money.;Jerry Saltz;art
I often find myself privately stewing about much British art, thinking that except for their tremendous gardens, that the English are not primarily visual artists, and are, in nearly unsurpassable ways, literary.;Jerry Saltz;art
A metaphysical tour de force of untethered meaning and involuting interlocking contrapuntal rhythms, 'The Clock' is more than a movie or even a work of art. It is so strange and other-ish that it becomes a stream-of-consciousness algorithm unto itself - something almost inhuman.;Jerry Saltz;art
I don't know much about auctions. I sometimes go to previews and see art sardined into ugly rooms. I've gawked at the gaudy prices, and gaped at well-clad crowds of happy white people conspicuously spending hundreds of millions of dollars.;Jerry Saltz;art
I love art dealers. In some ways, they're my favorite people in the art world. Really. I love that they put their money where their taste is, create their own aesthetic universes, support artists, employ people, and do all of this while letting us see art for free. Many are visionaries.;Jerry Saltz;art
When museums are built these days, architects, directors, and trustees seem most concerned about social space: places to have parties, eat dinner, wine-and-dine donors. Sure, these are important these days - museums have to bring in money - but they gobble up space and push the art itself far away from the entrance.;Jerry Saltz;art
I see 30 to 40 gallery shows a week, and no matter what kind of mood I'm in, no matter how bad the art is, I almost always feel better afterward. I can learn as much from bad art as from good.;Jerry Saltz;art
Jeffrey Deitch is the Jeff Koons of art dealers. Not because he's the biggest, best, or the richest of his kind. But because in some ways he's the weirdest (which is saying a lot when you're talking about the wonderful, wicked, lovable, and annoying creatures known as art dealers).;Jerry Saltz;art
Many say an art dealer running a museum is a 'conflict of interest.' But maybe the art world has lived an artificial or unintentional lie all of these years when it comes to conflicts of interest.;Jerry Saltz;art
Of course art world ethics are important. But museums are no purer than any other institution or business. Academics aren't necessarily more high-minded than gallerists.;Jerry Saltz;art
We're all entitled to opinions about how art institutions should behave, and entitled to voicing those opinions through whatever means available to us. We're also allowed to change or modify our opinions.;Jerry Saltz;art
Art is a marriage of the conscious and the unconscious.;Jean Cocteau;art
I don't listen to what art critics say. I don't know anybody who needs a critic to find out what art is.;Jean-Michel Basquiat;art
To play safe, I prefer to accept only one type of power: the power of art over trash, the triumph of magic over the brute.;Vladimir Nabokov;art
Writing is truly a creative art - putting word to a blank piece of paper and ending up with a full-fledged story rife with character and plot.;William Shatner;art
Cinema is still a very young art form with extraordinary techniques and very impressive special effects but sometimes it seems the soul has been taken out of things.;Catherine Deneuve;art
Out with stereotypes, feminism proclaims. But stereotypes are the west's stunning sexual personae, the vehicles of art's assault against nature. The moment there is imagination, there is myth.;Camille Paglia;art
Once you take yourself too seriously the art will suffer.;Maynard James Keenan;art
Politics is the art of preventing people from busying themselves with what is their own business.;Paul Valery;art
What the mass media offers is not popular art, but entertainment which is intended to be consumed like food, forgotten, and replaced by a new dish.;W. H. Auden;art
Trauma happens in relationships, so it can only be healed in relationships. Art can't provide healing. It can be cathartic and therapeutic but a relationship is a three-part journey.;Alanis Morissette;art
Art is not a pastime but a priesthood.;Jean Cocteau;art
Irresponsibility is part of the pleasure of all art it is the part the schools cannot recognize.;James Joyce;art
As in nature, as in art, so in grace it is rough treatment that gives souls, as well as stones, their luster.;Thomas Guthrie;art
The art of writing is the art of discovering what you believe.;Gustave Flaubert;art
Art requires neither complaisance nor politeness nothing but faith, faith and freedom.;Gustave Flaubert;art
You can calculate the worth of a man by the number of his enemies, and the importance of a work of art by the harm that is spoken of it.;Gustave Flaubert;art
There are neither good nor bad subjects. From the point of view of pure Art, you could almost establish it as an axiom that the subject is irrelevant, style itself being an absolute manner of seeing things.;Gustave Flaubert;art
The only way to avoid being unhappy is to close yourself up in Art and to count for nothing all the rest.;Gustave Flaubert;art
The cult of art gives pride one never has too much of it.;Gustave Flaubert;art
The artist must create a spark before he can make a fire and before art is born, the artist must be ready to be consumed by the fire of his own creation.;Auguste Rodin;art
With care, and skill, and cunning art, She parried Time's malicious dart, And kept the years at bay, Till passion entered in her heart and aged her in a day!;Ella Wheeler Wilcox;art
Man is unique not because he does science, and his is unique not because he does art, but because science and art equally are expressions of his marvelous plasticity of mind.;Jacob Bronowski;art
Modern bodybuilding is ritual, religion, sport, art, and science, awash in Western chemistry and mathematics. Defying nature, it surpasses it.;Camille Paglia;art
I do not regard advertising as entertainment or an art form, but as a medium of information.;David Ogilvy;art
Love the art in yourself and not yourself in the art.;Constantin Stanislavski;art
Art and science have their meeting point in method.;Edward G. Bulwer-Lytton;art
Flirting is the gentle art of making a man feel pleased with himself.;Helen Rowland;art
I have never denied my background or my culture. I have taught my child to embrace her Mexican heritage, to love my first language, Spanish, to learn about Mexican history, music, folk art, food, and even the Mexican candy I grew up with.;Salma Hayek;art
A nation devoid of art and artists cannot have a full existence.;Kemal Ataturk;art
It's an art to live with pain... mix the light into gray.;Eddie Vedder;art
Art is born of humiliation.;W. H. Auden;art
Art is much less important than life, but what a poor life without it.;Robert Motherwell;art
I got my diploma from Ealing College of Art, in graphics and illustration.;Freddie Mercury;art
Diplomacy, n. is the art of letting somebody else have your way.;David Frost;art
In the first book of my Discworld series, published more than 26 years ago, I introduced Death as a character there was nothing particularly new about this - death has featured in art and literature since medieval times, and for centuries we have had a fascination with the Grim Reaper.;Terry Pratchett;art
In mathematics the art of proposing a question must be held of higher value than solving it.;Georg Cantor;art
Poetry is a beautiful way of spoiling prose, and the laborious art of exchanging plain sense for harmony.;Horace Walpole;art
Music is God's gift to man, the only art of Heaven given to earth, the only art of earth we take to Heaven.;Walter Savage Landor;art
The public history of modern art is the story of conventional people not knowing what they are dealing with.;Golda Meir;art
I think art is inherently nonviolent and it actually occupies your mind with creation rather than destruction.;Anthony Kiedis;art
Modernity is the transient, the fleeting, the contingent it is one half of art, the other being the eternal and the immovable.;Charles Baudelaire;art
Who would dare assign to art the sterile function of imitating nature?;Charles Baudelaire;art
Art! Who comprehends her? With whom can one consult concerning this great goddess?;Ludwig van Beethoven;art
Black literature is taught as sociology, as tolerance, not as a serious, rigorous art form.;Toni Morrison;art
Art is always criticized and always an outsider gets the blame.;Ville Valo;art
Medicine is a science of uncertainty and an art of probability.;William Osler;art
Art saved me it got me through my depression and self-loathing, back to a place of innocence.;Jeanette Winterson;art
Artists don't talk about art. Artists talk about work. If I have anything to say to young writers, it's stop thinking of writing as art. Think of it as work.;Paddy Chayefsky;art
Jazz is known all over the world as an American musical art form and that's it. No America, no jazz. I've seen people try to connect it to other countries, for instance to Africa, but it doesn't have a damn thing to do with Africa.;Art Blakey;art
Art attracts us only by what it reveals of our most secret self.;Alfred North Whitehead;art
To injure an opponent is to injure yourself. To control aggression without inflicting injury is the Art of Peace.;Morihei Ueshiba;art
I'm very manipulative towards directors. My theory is that everyone on the set is directing the film, we're all receiving art messages from the universe on how we should do the film.;Jeff Bridges;art
I'm very much into the costuming of any character that I portray and it's one of the great things about making movies is it's a collaborative art form so you get all these artists who are looking specifically about for this instance your character's costume and what that might tell about your character.;Jeff Bridges;art
A primary function of art and thought is to liberate the individual from the tyranny of his culture in the environmental sense and to permit him to stand beyond it in an autonomy of perception and judgment.;Beverly Sills;art
Becoming emancipated at 14, my life wasn't normal. I didn't have to go to school, so I didn't. I was rebellious by nature. I spent my 20s focusing on my company, Flower Films, and producing movies. Now that I'm almost 30, I would like to try other things in lie. I'm crazy about photography, and I want to take an art history class.;Drew Barrymore;art

One of the main reasons I am so drawn to Hitchcock is that he planned his shots way in advance on story-boards, which he designed like classic paintings (he was an art connoisseur). It's why he found shooting on set boring - because he had already composed the film in his head.;Camille Paglia;art
Madonna remains the most visible performer on the planet, as well as one of the wealthiest, but would anyone seriously say that artistic self-development is her primary motivating principle?

To me, art supplies are always okay to buy.;Louis C. K.;art

More than art, more than literature, music is universally accessible.;Billy Joel;art

There's no being wrong in seeing something in art, only being disagreed with.;Jonathan Safran Foer;art

Only in men's imagination does every truth find an effective and undeniable existence. Imagination, not invention, is the supreme master of art as of life.;Joseph Conrad;art
The idea of avant-garde art is a very suspicious thing to me, the idea that poetry is new and it keeps being new the way Chevrolets every year are new.;Robert Morgan;art

Art is nature speeded up and God slowed down.;Malcolm De Chazal;art
There was a big drive when I was at art school to make you aware of the economy of meaning - after all, this was still during the tail end of minimalism.

To open the wound and keep it clean.;Jane Campion;art
I was very much into buying contemporary art, but I've just decided I want to get rid of it all. Not that it's not great art, but all of a sudden my mood has changed, and I want to go back to seventeenth- and eighteenth-century masters.;Sylvester Stallone;art

I went to England in the '70s, and I was in my early 20s. There was still a residue of that era of being an underclass or colonial. I assume it must have been a more aggressive and prominent attitude 40 years before that, because Australia internationally wasn't regarded as having much cultural value. We were a country full of sheep and convicts.;Geoffrey Rush;attitude
For a writer only one form of patriotism exists: his attitude toward language.;Joseph Brodsky;attitude
Gardening is not trivial. If you believe that it is, closely examine why you feel that way.

The fact is, gardening is just the opposite - it is, or should be, a central, basic expression of human life.;Andrew Weil;attitude

I fell in love with Erica Kane the summer before my freshman year of high school. Like all red-blooded teen American boys, I'd come home from water polo practice and eat a box of Entenmann's Pop'Ems donut holes in front of the TV while obsessively fawning over 'All My Children' and Erica, her clothes, and her narcissistic attitude.;Andy Cohen;attitude
Films for TV have to be much closer to the book, mainly because the objective with a TV movie that translates literature is to get the audience, after seeing this version, to pick up the book and read it themselves. My attitude is that TV can never really be any form of art, because it serves audience expectations.;Michael Haneke;attitude
You can't beat the beehive for glam punkette attitude.;Rob Sheffield;attitude

What reader wants to be told what attitude to strike?;Ian Mcewan;attitude

Even as a little child, I've always had that comedian kind of attitude.;Etta James;attitude

In the late '70s, maybe just before I started, there was still an attitude that if you did film you didn't do TV and vice versa, but that's gone now.;Robert Carlyle;attitude

I love her attitude, but as much as I'd like to bring my medals to a speech or appearance, I never do.;Mary Lou Retton;attitude

What sculptors do is represent the essence of gesture. What is important in mime is attitude.;Marcel Marceau;attitude

I have played on many teams throughout my career, and I know when a team has the tools, and the right positive attitude towards winning.;Boomer Esiason;attitude
Vampires are so old that they don't need to impress anyone anymore. They're comfortable in their own skin. It's this enigmatic strength that's very romantic and old-fashioned.

I'm just part of a tradition of people who aren't pleased. I would never think anyone else who has the same attitude was getting it from me. I'd just think they're... sensible.;Jack Dee;attitude

At home in Ireland, there's a habit of avoidance, an ironical attitude towards the authority figure.;Seamus Heaney;attitude
Even if people do wrong, we're social animals, so what can we do about stopping them doing the same things in future? Saying people are 'bad' or 'evil' is just an unwillingness to engage an unwillingness to try to empathise. That sanctimonious attitude doesn't help anyone.;Denise Mina;attitude

Time plays a role in almost every decision. And some decisions define your attitude about time.;John Cale;attitude

But having said that, there's also a sea change in attitude towards media.;Robert McChesney;attitude

When you Google me, you'll find a lot of people don't like Richard Dreyfuss. Because I'm cocky and I present a cocky attitude. But no one has ever disagreed with the notion I represent, that we need more civic education. So far there's 100 percent support for that.;Richard Dreyfuss;attitude
My mother, she had a very good attitude toward money. I'm very grateful for the fact that we had to learn to save. I used to get like 50 pence a week, and I'd save it for like five months.

Too many people say to their brokers, I can't deal with this. Take my money. Do what you want. That's the worst attitude you can have.;Maria Bartiromo;attitude

I am shocked by the easy attitude of many in the media towards disclosing our Nation's secrets.;Todd Tiahrt;attitude
I always give Lindsay so much credit for her tennis game, for her attitude, for her person, and because of how she deals with all the things. I don't think people give her enough credit for how well she's doing.;Martina Hingis;attitude
I don't know that I have any role models now that are fixed. Definitely my mom - she's the coolest. She's worked really hard her whole life and I just think she's got a great attitude. Moms just know so much it's so silly.;Larisa Oleynik;attitude

The war changed everybody's attitude. We became international almost overnight.;W. Averell Harriman;attitude

I like England more than I did when I left. It's become a bit of a better country in the last ten years, in the attitude of it. A bit more Americanized, which is both good and bad. At least when you order a cup of coffee they don't give you a hard time.;Teddy Thompson;attitude
What a stupid attitude we have in this country to personal stories.;Amanda Burton;attitude
I have a Woody Allen Jewish attitude to life: that it's all going to be disastrous. That it hasn't all been that way is simply down to some random quirk of fate.;Antony Sher;attitude

In aid, the proper attitude is one omitting gratitude.;Marya Mannes;attitude
In Scotland over many years we have cultivated through our justice system what I hope can be described as a 'culture of compassion.'

I like actors that are good with pantomime and that can transmit a lot by their presence and attitude more than through their dialogue.;Guillermo del Toro;attitude
Having a child makes you strong and gives you chutzpah. It relaxed my attitude to the job my center of focus shifted, which I think is very helpful, because even if you're not a very indulgent actor you spend a lot of time thinking about yourself. I don't think that is particularly healthy.;Imelda Staunton;attitude
I always said punk was an attitude. It was never about having a Mohican haircut or wearing a ripped T-shirt. It was all about destruction, and the creative potential within that.;Malcolm Mclaren;attitude
Sid Vicious began the age of participation in which everyone could be the artist. Sid proved that you don't have to play well to be the star. You can play badly, or not even at all.

Abhorrence of apartheid is a moral attitude, not a policy.;Edward Heath;attitude
Every baseball crowd, like every theatre audience, has its own distinctive attitude and atmosphere.;Bill Veeck;attitude

The attitude we have towards our personal pets as opposed to the animals that suffer under the factory farm is hypocritical and delusional.;James Cromwell;attitude
Certain kinds of speed, flow, intensity, density of attacks, density of interaction... Music that concentrates on those qualities is, I think, easier achieved by free improvisation between people sharing a common attitude, a common language.;Evan Parker;attitude
I saw 'Taxi Driver,' and 'Taxi Driver' kind of saved my life. The scene where Robert De Niro is looking at himself in the mirror saying, 'You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? Who the hell else are you talkin' to?' That's the scene that changed my life by changing my attitude about acting.;Michael Biehn;attitude
I've always been a guy who's pretty supportive, its just my nature, so I came in to the situation with the attitude that I wanted to support Johnny and make it work.;Rick Derringer;attitude

What has happened is that to some degree they have taken an attitude where they don't listen to demos of diverse subject matters. They're looking for demos like the record the guy on the left just did.;Grandmaster Flash;attitude

But I do think that we approach music, in of itself, with a religious attitude.;Jon Fishman;attitude
I think that generally music should be a positive thing, I like Bob Marley's attitude: he said that his goal in life was to single handedly fight all the evil in the world with nothing but music, and when he went to a place he didn't go to play, he went to conquer.;Jon Fishman;attitude
In 1977, at least, he wished to have people believe that he shared and was proud of an attitude toward women that is not acceptable in a politician. In 2003, all he has said is that he doesn't remember the interview.;Michael Kinsley;attitude
You'd like more people to recognise what you do is special. But I take the attitude that the best thing I can do for my sport is to be the best at it. The best way people will come to recognise that track and field is a great sport is to see athletes excelling at it. Which is what I intend to do.;Maurice Greene;attitude
So at a time in which the media give the public everything it wants and desires, maybe art should adopt a much more aggressive attitude towards the public. I myself am very much inclined to take this position.;Thom Mayne;attitude

The game in beauty is changing so much, if your product isn't high tech or can't make a unique performance claim - plump your lips, reduce your lines, look glossy, and stay on for 24 hours - you can't go to market today.

I just thought, 'What?';Christina Hendricks;birthday

There are pros and cons of experience. A con is that you can't look at the business with a fresh pair of eyes and as objectively as if you were a new CEO. Fire yourself on a Friday night and come in on Monday morning as if a search firm put you there as a turn-around leader. Can you be objective and make the bold change?;Andrea Jung;business
Would you want to do business with a person who was 99% honest?;Sydney Madwed;business
I happened to come along in the music business when there was no trend.;Elvis Presley;business
The business side of film has goofed up so many things, but even that's changing. It happened to the music industry and now it's happening to the film studios. It's crazy what's going on. But artists should have control of their work especially if, as I always say, you never turn down a good idea and never take a bad idea.;David Lynch;business
Some of the greatest actors have turned superheroes into a serious business: Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson in 'Batman' Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart, the first venerable knights of the X-Men, who have now passed the baton to Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy.;Tom Hiddleston;business
Run a home like you would a small business and treat it with the same seriousness.;Anthea Turner;business
I know I did the right thing by taking time off to raise my son. But it also came at a price.

And in Hollywood, as in any business, the calls stop coming when you don't answer.;Arsenio Hall;business
I never get the accountants in before I start up a business. It's done on gut feeling, especially if I can see that they are taking the mickey out of the consumer.;Richard Branson;business

And what most people don't understand is the bulk of business in this country is small business.;Alphonso Jackson;business

I am a sensitive writer, actor and director. Talking business disgusts me. If you want to talk business, call my disgusting personal manager.;Sylvester Stallone;business

Like sex in Victorian England, the reality of Big Business today is our big dirty secret.;Ralph Nader;business
Really, I have to laugh because there was a whole set of stories that made me sound like the Dragon Lady, you know, 'tough this and tough that.' Then there is this business about 'gooey.' The bottom line is I am a pragmatic idealist.;Madeleine Albright;business

In the coming years, if not sooner, social media will become a powerful tool that consumers will aggressively use to influence business attitudes and force companies into greater social responsibility - and, I suggest, move us towards a more sustainable practice of capitalism.;Simon Mainwaring;business
Perhaps the most effective way to describe the approach a brand must take is to think of themselves as social cartographers. By that I mean that brands must simultaneously inspire, engage and maintain a series of conversations taking place within certain cultural landscape specific to their business goal.;Simon Mainwaring;business
The social business marketplace is effectively forcing brands to engage with consumers on the basis of something that is meaningful to them. More often than not, this takes the form of some core value that finds expression in a non-profit cause.;Simon Mainwaring;business
Integrate purpose into your for-profit business model through a long term commitment to a cause that is aligned with your core values and those of your community.;Simon Mainwaring;business
In today's social business marketplace Facebook is one of the best places for nonprofits to be discovered and connect with a larger audience on the basis of shared values. So to get started, a non-profit should launch a Facebook page and invite your existing real world community to connect your cause and their networks.;Simon Mainwaring;business
In the social business marketplace, brands that hope to build loyal and growing communities do so most effectively when they demonstrate their core values and allow a community to build and engage around it.;Simon Mainwaring;business

We need to stop apologizing for celebrating life. We need to stop apologizing for wanting to protect an individual's right to build a business.;Rick Perry;business
Somebody has to tell the E.P.A. that we don't need you monkeying around and fiddling around and getting in our business with every kind of regulation you can dream up. You're doing nothing more than killing jobs. It's a cemetery for jobs at the E.P.A.;Rick Perry;business
We must have ideals and try to live up to them, even if we never quite succeed. Life would be a sorry business without them. With them it's grand and great.;Lucy Maud Montgomery;business

I'm very free-spirited and crazy. I love to have fun, and I like doing stupid things. At the same time, I'm like a 35-year-old. I have a house. I have a car. I have a steady job. I have a business, and I have to make serious decisions.;Avril Lavigne;business
And I want to do it the right way, like everybody else, not just a famous figurehead that gets a job because he is a famous basketball player. I want to really learn the business.;Shaquille O'Neal;business

Understand why casinos and racetracks stay in business - the gambler always loses over the long term.;Marilyn vos Savant;business

I couldn't be an ingenue today, because the business has changed. I remember when you could dress for a premiere just by putting on a cute top. Now you have to be perfect and fabulous in every way, or you're ridiculed.;Julia Roberts;business

I think we have to notice that the business processes we use right now for thinking and planning and budgeting and strategy are all delivered on very tight agendas.;Margaret J. Wheatley;business
The 9-9-9 plan would resuscitate this economy because it replaces the outdated tax code that allows politicians to pick winners and losers, and to provide favors in the form of tax breaks, special exemptions and loopholes. It simplifies the code dramatically: 9% business flat tax, 9% personal flat tax, 9% sales tax.;Herman Cain;business
I don't have more money. I won't have more money than any of the candidates, even the Republican candidates. We know that already. But we are building this campaign team like I would build a business. And that is, we are building it so far with no debt.;Herman Cain;business
Whether you were talking about Pillsbury, Burger King, Godfather's, the National Restaurant Association, in each one of those situations, I had a daunting problem that I had to solve.

My approach to cutting spending as president, is to do a ten percent across the board cut of all federal agencies, and then ask each of my new agency heads to find another ten percent by drilling down.

Half the time men think they are talking business, they are wasting time.;E. W. Howe;business
I've seen so many people in this business that made a fortune. They get old and broke and can't make any money. I tell you something... no one's going to play a benefit for Jimmy Dean.;Jimmy Dean;business
I do not understand how it is that financial institutions could think that they could take taxpayer money and then turn around and act like it's business as usual.

Man, I don't want to have nothing to do with computers. I don't want the government in my business.;Erykah Badu;business
Music and the music business are two different things.;Erykah Badu;business
Don't solicit feedback on your product, idea or your business just for validation purposes.

It can stop a lot of multimillion-dollar ideas in their tracks in the beginning.;Sara Blakely;business
There's no business like show business, but there are several businesses like accounting.;David Letterman;business

Teenage girls these days are more and more getting lured into thinking they should dumb themselves down, and that's going to attract the wrong kind of guy, and it's serious. It's serious business.;Danica McKellar;business
The camera fails to capture the 'business' in show business! We typically will give 10 percent of our salary to the agent, 10 percent to the manager, and 5 percent to the lawyer, plus the publicist gets a flat fee, which needs to be budgeted for.;Danica McKellar;business
The movie business is a big gamble.;Jackie Chan;business

You shouldn't be in the music business if you're posing.;Rod Stewart;business
Like everybody in show business, you think you're going to wake up one day, and it's all going to be taken away from you. I think we all share an insecurity in that way, everybody in show business - the ones I talk to, anyway.;Rod Stewart;business

I learned you have to fight for yourself in the picture business.;Loretta Young;business
As an actress, emotions are my business, my stock-in-trade. As such, I've dealt with them nearly all my life.;Loretta Young;business
I think people are used to seeing actors be wide open and desperately giving of themselves, and while I do that on a movie set as much as I can, it's so unnatural for me to do it on television, in interviews, in anything like that. I also don't find that my process as an actor is really anyone else's business.;Kristen Stewart;business
A business like an automobile, has to be driven, in order to get results.;B. C. Forbes;business
After I left the White House, I kept a foothold in the business of American politics as a talk-show host, analyst, commentator, speechmaker, and occasional writer. I was no longer a practitioner, but I was still a partisan, a Democrat, a blue-stater through and through.;Dee Dee Myers;business

In America, we no longer have an institutionalized, organized way of calling business to task - of taking them to account for what they've done - and this is especially true in the cultural realm.;Thomas Frank;business

As you watch the world crumble, try taking your Armageddon with this sprinkling of irony: Over the last three decades, business has got virtually everything it wanted, and its doomsday scenario from the 1970s has come true because of it.;Thomas Frank;business

I think in politics, in Congress, you often do things that are Republican, or you do things because you're a Democrat. Sometimes that's good, obviously, and sometimes that's obviously bad. But in the news business, there's no such thing as Republican or Democratic news. News is news.;J. C. Watts;business
I have watched people who have nothing to do with the film business, but who have become part of the circle for a short period of time. They can be truly devastated when the film wraps and people leave.;Jacqueline Bisset;business
This film business, perhaps more so in America than in Europe, has always been about young sexuality. It's not true of theatre, but in America, film audiences are young. It's not an intellectual cinema in America.;Jacqueline Bisset;business

In principle, there are only three main components of spending that much matter to monetary policy: consumer spending, business investment and exports and trade.;Evan Davis;business
Politicians also have a love affair with the 'small business exemption.' Too much paperwork? Too heavy a burden? Not enough time? Just exempt small businesses from the rule. It sounds so pro-growth.

Today I can announce a raft of reforms that we estimate could save over 2.5 million police hours every year. That's the equivalent of more than 1,200 police officer posts.

I am just at that stage of wondering where I go from here. I came into this business almost by accident, but now it has become serious.

I have no business being a journalist. I'm the least, I'm the least - I'm the most trusting, I absolutely make a habit of believing anything that anybody tells me about themselves.

There is the expression of selfishness and there is the expression of selflessness - but economists or theoreticians never touched that part. They said: 'Go and become a philanthropist.'

I stayed in show business to pay for my animal business.;Betty White;business
I always wanted to be a zookeeper when I was growing up, and I've wound up a zookeeper! I've been working with the Los Angeles Zoo for 45 years!

You can't ask for better than two things you love the most.;Betty White;business
I am interested in a lot of things - not just show business and my passion for animals. I try to keep current in what's going on in the world. I do mental exercises.

Rock stars get room keys, I get business cards.;Thomas Friedman;business
The people who are competing business-wise out there want what other successful labels and artists have. I don't want what they have I want my own path, my own sound, my own identity. Record labels care nothing about identity or artistic freedom, they want good business.;Joe Nichols;business

I do not want to admit to the world that I can be a bad person. It is just that I don't want anyone to have false expectations.

And then I had to run like hell to catch up with my own image.;Barbara Corcoran;business
My husband had a very strong identity and was successful in his life. Thank God for that. There's no way I can control him. I wouldn't stay married to him if I felt I could.

People are always saying that Hollywood messes up kids. I'm like, 'No, families mess up kids!' I grew up in Hollywood, and I'm perfectly fine. If my children want to go into the entertainment business, I won't stop them, as long as they're passionate about it.;Tori Spelling;business
The Internet creates as well as destroys. Social networks, search advertising, and cloud computing are multibillion dollar industries that didn't exist 10 years ago. They are products of the same force that has rendered the Postal Service's core business obsolete.;John Sununu;business
If you create something that is asking for people to respond as they're going to respond, you have to allow them to respond as they're going to respond.

Energy and environmental regulation, transportation, and broadband policy all benefit when legislators have a basic grounding in the technical concepts behind business models, products, and innovation.;John Sununu;business
If you say, 'I'm going to cut this song because I know the teenagers are going to love it,' well, then you're going to alienate everybody else. When I cut my record, I'm just going to cut the things that I like, and whoever likes it, likes it. That's too much work to try to figure out the demographic. That's too much like a business.;Jason Aldean;business
Barack Obama's life was so much simpler in 2009. Back then, he had refined the cold act of blaming others for the bad economy into an art form. Deficits? Blame Bush's tax cuts. Spending? Blame the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. No business investment? Blame Wall Street.;John Sununu;business

Design can never be an ultimate explanation for anything. It can only be a proximate explanation. A plane or a car is explained by a designer but that's because the designer himself, the engineer, is explained by natural selection.;Richard Dawkins;car
To attract men, I wear a perfume called 'New Car Interior.';Rita Rudner;car
I am thankful the most important key in history was invented. It's not the key to your house, your car, your boat, your safety deposit box, your bike lock or your private community. It's the key to order, sanity, and peace of mind. The key is 'Delete.';Elayne Boosler;car
American stuntmen are smart - they think about safety. When they do a jump in a car, they calculate everything: the speed, the distance... But in Hong Kong, we don't know how to count. Everything we do is a guess. If you've got the guts, you do it. All of my stuntmen have gotten hurt.;Jackie Chan;car
It seems to me I spent my life in car pools, but you know, that's how I kept track of what was going on.;Barbara Bush;car

I know people think we drive around in these nice cars and we do whatever we want and our parents will pay our credit cards, but that's not the case. Sure, my parents were generous I got a nice car at 16, but at 18 I was cut off. I've worked really hard. I opened the store myself.;Kim Kardashian;car
White is actually one of my favorite colors. I have a white car. I love white.;Kim Kardashian;car
My brother was a lifeguard in a car wash.;Henny Youngman;car
I think a lot of writers, male and female, write as if their parents were killed in a car accident when they were 2, and they have no one to hold accountable. And unfortunately, I don't have that. I have parents who I care about what they think.;Mindy Kaling;car
I'm gonna be making records anyway, even if I had to sell 'em out of the trunk of my car. I'm that kind of musician and singer.;Dolly Parton;car

I don't want to argue with my wife about her car - or my driving.;Dale Earnhardt;car
People and squirrels are very different. Most people will not argue that. But I find that there is one situation in which they're very similar. And that is: when I am driving towards them in my car. Then they're kind of hard to tell apart - especially if the human is kind of hairy.;Demetri Martin;car

Drug misuse is not a disease, it is a decision, like the decision to step out in front of a moving car. You would call that not a disease but an error of judgment.;Philip K. Dick;car

I race to win. If I am on the bike or in a car it will always be the same.;Valentino Rossi;car
As soon as I get my car I think I'll be going to the cinema more. Since I don't go very often, there are no films that are a must see at the moment. I usually wait till they come out on DVD.;Tom Felton;car

I couldn't find the sports car of my dreams, so I built it myself.;Ferdinand Porsche;car

I've spent more on my Dodger tickets that I did on my car.;Shia LaBeouf;car
My first car, I got it in an auction at my temple. It was an '86 Volvo that I got for 500 bucks, and then wound up throwing $10,000 into the stereo system and put TVs in the foot rests. It was the most ridiculous Volvo you'd ever seen, but I had never had money before and I was out of my mind.;Shia LaBeouf;car
I remember driving to North Carolina when I was a little girl in a snowstorm to get down to my mom's family in the Carolinas. There were chains on the car - it was the late sixties - and we were just singing in the car. Christmas carols.;Tori Amos;car
My parents were what I like to call proper musical fans. Lots of Sondheim was played in the car.;Daniel Radcliffe;car
I grew up listening to show tunes in the back of the car.;Daniel Radcliffe;car

I want to let my friend Buster know that I would like to have dinner with him tonight. Does Buster work at home? Then how likely is he to have his cell phone on? Is he one of those people who only turns on his cell when he's in his car? I hate that.;Susan Orlean;car
Having played many roles of scientific intellect I do have an empathy for that world. It's been hard on me because flying the Enterprise for seven years in Star Trek and sitting in Cerebro in X-men has led people to believe that I know what I'm talking about. But I'm still trying to work out how to operate the air conditioning unit on my car.;Patrick Stewart;car
I never listen to the radio unless I rent a car.;David Byrne;car
You can know or not know how a car runs and still enjoy riding in a car.;David Byrne;car
I don't listen to the radio very much, but that could be because I don't have a car.;David Byrne;car
There's a certain amount of freedom involved in cycling: you're self-propelled and decide exactly where to go. If you see something that catches your eye to the left, you can veer off there, which isn't so easy in a car, and you can't cover as much ground walking.;David Byrne;car
I went to Zimbabwe. I know how white people feel in America now relaxed! Cause when I heard the police car I knew they weren't coming after me!;Richard Pryor;car

My grandma's the most careful, safe driver in the world. You put her in a rental car, and she's doing doughnuts in the K-Mart parking lot!;Jeff Foxworthy;car
I accept the Old Testament as more of an action movie: blood, car chases, evacuations, a lot of special effects, seas dividing, mass murder, adultery. The children of God are running amok, wayward. Maybe that's why they're so relatable.;Bono;car

I was hit by a car once on my bike, but I still rode home.;Amy Winehouse;car
Fact: The new '90210' is cooler than the old '90210.' It's the lithe, streamlined Skipper to the elder series' venerable Barbie. Gone are the traditional parents - they've been replaced by a hipster mom n' pop who get busted necking in the car.;Diablo Cody;car
The world is full of abundance and opportunity, but far too many people come to the fountain of life with a sieve instead of a tank car... a teaspoon instead of a steam shovel. They expect little and as a result they get little.;Ben Sweetland;car

I look away at car crashes, and I know people who look away at car crashes, because it makes us uncomfortable to watch other people in pain.;John Mayer;car
I really think we should pass a law in every state, I don't care whether it takes the independence away from an old person or not. You shouldn't be driving a car if you're over the age of 80. Maybe even less than that.;Evel Knievel;car
And that just shows you how important the car is in Formula One Racing.;Murray Walker;car
I love sleeping in a moving car more than sleeping in bed.;Ben Stein;car

Consider what kind of car you get. Buy cars and other products that have the least impact environmentally.;Al Gore;car
Once you become successful, people know where you live, the type of house you live in, the kind of car you drive, the clothes you wear, and so it would be patronising to go and talk like a welder. Welding's a mystery to me now. You can't go back, your life changes every day.;Billy Connolly;car
There is a limit to the application of democratic methods. You can inquire of all the passengers as to what type of car they like to ride in, but it is impossible to question them as to whether to apply the brakes when the train is at full speed and accident threatens.;Leon Trotsky;car
Food is not just what we put in our mouths to fill up it is culture and identity. Reason plays some role in our decisions about food, but it's rarely driving the car.;Jonathan Safran Foer;car
Removing the faults in a stage-coach may produce a perfect stage-coach, but it is unlikely to produce the first motor car.;Edward de Bono;car

The irony is that it was tougher to rent a car from Cerberus when it owned Alamo than to buy a semi-automatic. To rent a car, one had to provide ID, a drivers' license, and get insurance coverage. To buy a gun? Cash and carry, from the back of a station wagon at a gun show. No concerns about downstream liability or risk.;Eliot Spitzer;car
At least 50 times. I've jumped off a building, jumped off a cliff in a car. I've been in bedrooms when women came in with knives and guns.;Dennis Rodman;car
Can you design a Rorschach test that's going to make everyone feel something every time - and that looks like a Rorschach test? It's easy to show a picture of a kitten or a car accident. The question is, how abstract can you get and still get the audience to feel something when they don't know what's happening to them?;Jason Reitman;car
The American Dream has run out of gas. The car has stopped. It no longer supplies the world with its images, its dreams, its fantasies. No more. It's over. It supplies the world with its nightmares now: the Kennedy assassination, Watergate, Vietnam.;J. G. Ballard;car
You know what I really love? The CD players in a car. How when you put the CD right up by the slot, it actually takes it out of your hand, like it's hungry. It pulls it in, and you feel like it wants more silver discs.;Tom Waits;car

My definition of a redundancy is an air-bag in a politician's car.;Larry Hagman;car

A critic is a man who knows the way but can't drive the car.;Kenneth Tynan;car

I remember walking the dog one day, I saw a car full of teenage girls, and one of them rolled down the window and yelled, 'Marc Jacobs!' in a French accent.;Marc Jacobs;car

The bass player's function, along with the drums, is to be the engine that drives the car... everything else is merely colours.;Suzi Quatro;car
Spending $1 for a brand new house would feel very, very good. Spending $1,000 for a ham sandwich would feel very, very bad. Spending $19,000 for a small family car would feel, well, more or less right. But as with physical pain, fiscal pain can depend on the individual, and everyone has a different threshold.;Jeffrey Kluger;car
I think I'm actually quite a materialistic person, I value what it takes to make a car or build a nice house. Money does change things, but how it changes people depends on how they react to it.;Roland Gift;car
Sometimes I wish I could drive a car, but I'm gonna drive a car one day, so I don't worry about that.;Stevie Wonder;car
The year most of my high school friends and I got our driver's permits, the coolest thing one could do was stand outside after school and twirl one's car keys like a lifeguard whistle. That jingling sound meant freedom and power.;Sloane Crosley;car

I've always been a bit of a car freak.;Eric Bana;car
Over my lifetime, the car had actually transcended the fact that it is a car. It has become a venue.;Eric Bana;car

I enjoy racing historic motorcars from the '50s and '60s. The seed of my interest was planted when I was about 12 years old and took over my mother's Morris Minor. I drove it around my father's farm. But my favorite car is still a McLaren F1, which I have had for 10 years.;Rowan Atkinson;car

When I was really little I would sit in the back of my dad's car when he'd be playing old-school music. He'd turn down the music and turn around and I'd be singing and know all of the words but I didn't even know how to talk. From then on I've always wanted to be a singer.;Leona Lewis;car

Okay, let's talk about cartoon labels for half a second - some people think anything with a dog or a car or a colorful alien is garbage, which is not true. Look at Big Moose Red. It's, like, a $6 wine with a cheesy label, and it's actually a solid wine.;Gary Vaynerchuk;car
My mother is a big believer in being responsible for your own happiness. She always talked about finding joy in small moments and insisted that we stop and take in the beauty of an ordinary day.

I dated a guy and he liked me but I didn't like him. I went through his wardrobe and cleaned out his house and got him to get a new car.

That was the first match that led to me leaving my corporate job.;Patti Stanger;car
I'm lucky because my dad taught me to be frugal and save. And that's important because I want to know that I don't have to take an acting job for two or three years if I don't want to and that I'll still be able to make my house and car payments and buy food for my dogs.;Ashley Greene;car

I mean, you've kind of got the track down, especially with ovals. The only thing that improves is that when race conditions come, you know what to expect slightly more from the track and from your car.;Danica Patrick;car
I think that Indy is special to me. The greater the distance between the last time I drove an Indy car and the next time, I wouldn't like that to be too big.;Danica Patrick;car
On Memorial Day, I was out floating on Lake Norman and came across Denny Hamlin. We struck up a conversation, and one of the first things we were talking about was how much it helped him when he started racing the Cup car and how much it helped his Nationwide program.;Danica Patrick;car

No matter how good you are, how brave you are or anything, it comes down to that car so many times. Not every time, but so many times.;Danica Patrick;car
I'm a big believer in everybody being themselves. If not doing a swimsuit calendar is yourself, that's great. But if doing a swimsuit calendar is yourself, then you should be able to do it. What I do outside the car adds to who I am and expresses a different side of me.;Danica Patrick;car
I think women like Ferraris. A Ferrari is everybody's car.;Tim Allen;car
Freedom is not an ideal, it is not even a protection, if it means nothing more than freedom to stagnate, to live without dreams, to have no greater aim than a second car and another television set.;Adlai Stevenson;car
I started rapping before anybody had ever bought a car from it. It was truly about the art form and the culture, more so than now, where it's a successful way to make money. Back then you had to be doing it because you liked it.;Ice T;car
Austin sounds a little bit like Aston Martin, which is the type of car James Bond would drive.;Mike Myers;car
Racism has been for everyone like a horrible, tragic car crash, and we've all been heavily sedated from it. If we don't come into consciousness of this tragedy, there's going to be a violent awakening we don't want. The question is, can we wake up?;Anna Deavere Smith;car
It was my father who instilled the 'never say no' attitude I carry around with me today, and who instilled in me a sense of wonder, always taking us on adventures in the car, never telling us the destination.;Marlee Matlin;car
I did this Super-8 film at art school called 'Tissues,' this black comedy about a family whose father has been arrested for child molestation. I was absolutely thrilled by every inch of it, and would throw my projector in the back of my car and show it to anybody who would watch it.;Jane Campion;car
The culture is going into a psychological depression. We are concerned about our place in the world, about being competitive: Will my children have as much as I have? Will I ever own my own home? How can I pay for a new car? Are immigrants taking away my white world?;James Hillman;car
By the time the children go to bed, I am as drained as any mother who has spent her day working, car pooling, building Lego castles and shopping for the precisely correct soccer cleat.;Ayelet Waldman;car
I think we've been dulled by capitalism. We're just blobs now - we're so worried about how we can keep paying the lease on the car, the mortgage, the lease on the toaster and all that. You can't really think about much else. If you lose that, you lose the whole lot.;Rupert Everett;car
Before now, I've always taken my mixes out to the car and listened to them in the parking lot. I still do that, but more so now I'm listening to it on the Beat box, and I think people should give it at least a listen and check it out and see what it is.;Dr. Dre;car
I like structure - like driving: go past the school on the street, stay on the right side, no hitting the car, go in right, you'll see a big church, stop and take a left, and you'll have it. By doing this I'm giving a structure of life, a path of light, and showing what happens between me and me, which is something very beautiful.;Jean Claude Van Damme;car
I'd kind of like to have a classic old muscle car. I think that would be fun.;Brooke Burke;car
Once I accepted Christ I immediately had peace. I still didn't have a place to live, I still didn't have a car, but I had peace.;Sherri Shepherd;car
When I was a kid I got busted for throwing a rock through a car window and egging a house on halloween.;Gavin DeGraw;car
Sometimes movie-making happens like clockwork other times, like a car accident.;Eric Roberts;car
I don't put myself on Jeff Beck's level, but I can relate to him when he says he'd rather be working on his car collection than playing the guitar.;Ritchie Blackmore;car
The thing people don't understand is that touring or travelling or whatever you do in my position means you go to all these cool places all over the world, but you see everything from a car window. You don't get to see much of the city or meet people at all.;Taylor Momsen;car
I'm just attracted to playing people who are ostensible unlikable. That's not to say that there's something in there that makes you care. It might be that you just find them so awful that you just can't stop watching, like a car crash.;Steve Coogan;car
I like to put on hardcore when I have to clean my apartment, which I hate to do, but it's motivational. I like old heavy metal when I'm outside working on my car. Music has definite functions for me.;Peter Steele;car
I don't actually own a car.;Chris Martin;car
The only thing I do on a computer is play Texas Hold 'Em, really. Obviously my cell phone is a computer. My car is a computer. I'm on computers every day without actively seeking them out.;John Hawkes;car
Johnny Guitar... just one of my favorite singers of all time. I met him when we were both on the road with Johnny Otis in the '50s when I was a teenager. We traveled the country in a car together.I would hear him sing every night.;Etta James;car
But I have a driver, so I can return calls while I'm in the car.;Donna Shalala;car
L.A. has a fantastic car scene and because the climate is so gentle, cars can last forever.;Lee Child;car
I'd really like to get the girl, shoot the gun, drive the car, have fun. I even have these kind of action dreams, where I'm the action guy.;Kevin Bacon;car
I was raised in Chicago and I guess that was one of the special breeding grounds for gangsters of all colors. That was the Detroit of the gangster world. The car industry was thugs.;Quincy Jones;car
I sing in the car if I'm in LA, because you're like soundproofed.;Jimmy Fallon;car
We had the guys from X Men 2 do the cameras. They had a 360 camera that would go from one car, up in the air and over to another car in a continuous shot while the film was still rolling, going 90 mph.;Jimmy Fallon;car
In New York, you've got Donald Trump, Woody Allen, a crack addict and a regular Joe, and they're all on the same subway car.;Ethan Hawke;car
I was turning 20 during my first record. Those decade birthdays always kind of cause me, it seems, to reflect, look back, and then look forward. I just was closing this period of my life where I was living in a car and scrambling my whole life to then signing a six-record deal with Atlantic.;Jewel;car
In addition to this, they already have a fuel cell car on the road in Japan. It is subsidized from within the corporation because they are still at a high cost.;Maurice Strong;car
Toyota was the first to put a commercial fuel cell powered car on the road, and I have no doubt that Toyota will continue to be in the front lines in the development of competitive fuel cell vehicles.;Maurice Strong;car
I borrowed my friend's car the other day in an attempt to persuade my husband that we needed a car and literally this is true, in the first day of borrowing the car, I got three tickets and I rear-ended it.;Emily Mortimer;car
I used to look like a deer in headlights on the red carpet. You step out of the car and it's bedlam. Everyone's got crazy eyes.;Emily Blunt;car
Well, I've been in a few car wrecks.;Dave Matthews;car
I don't want a flashy car, just something that would allow me to stop using the Tube. And it would be good not to have to rely on my mum all the time, particularly when I have to listen to her singing in her car.;Andy Murray;car
When you read about a car crash in which two or three youngsters are killed, do you pause to dwell on the amount of love and treasure and patience parents poured into bodies no longer suitable for open caskets?;Jim Bishop;car
A life can get knocked into a new orbit by a car crash, a lottery win or just a bleary-eyed consultant giving bad news in a calm voice.;David Mitchell;car
Home, nowadays, is a place where part of the family waits till the rest of the family brings the car back.;Earl Wilson;car
With all the hybrid stuff and things like that, I think that's a fabulous direction to go with cars in that sense. As someone who grew up around muscle cars, I'll never not be able to not love a muscle car. Not that I don't care about the environment, that's not it. But I adore muscle cars.;Michael Symon;car
I don't even own a car.;Bill Nighy;car
Of course, I'm older now. I'm in a different place in my life than when I wrote the songs for 'Car Wheels' or 'Essence' or whatever. Different things were going on.;Lucinda Williams;car
I hate fishing, and I can't imagine why anyone would want to hike when you can get in the car and drive.;Joseph Barbera;car
I would make tea for Joni Mitchell or clean her car, anything to be in the studio and watch her work.;Sheena Easton;car
If any demonstrator ever lays down in front of my car, it'll be the last car he'll ever lay down in front of.;George C. Wallace;car
I am endlessly busy, bringing up five young kids, and trying to keep up with the three older ones. I still spend most of my life driving car pools.;Danielle Steel;car
Yes, I did and a lot of my friends who are in the same program as I were very much supportive, and the most important thing they said to me is do not let this interfere with what you have to do in taking car of yourself. That was the most important thing.;Naomi Campbell;car
I read murder mysteries. I exercise 40 minutes a day. I watch videotapes while I exercise. I listen to audiotapes when I am in my car. And I try to stay in three different centuries.;Grover Norquist;car
People don't understand that it was maybe my biggest pleasure to drive an F1 car when it's wet.;Alain Prost;car
The people who criticise you will not be the ones taking care of your legs when you are in your wheelchair. People who never drove a car in these conditions, they just don't know.;Alain Prost;car
When you're in a car which can win every race, or fight for a win every race, that is pressure.;Jenson Button;car
We go through the whole season working on next season's car and developing the car and making sure we fit in the car and all that sort of stuff. And we obviously give ideas of what we would hope next year's car would have even if it's small things like buttons on the steering wheel and different positions and whatever.;Jenson Button;car
We all drive differently and have different styles. For me I need a car I can develop beneath me and feel comfortable in. If the car feels neutral and unbalanced it doesn't work for me.;Jenson Button;car
I need to develop a car and engineer a car in a position that feels comfortable for me, and I don't think anyone can do a better job than I can in that position. The problem for me is if I can't get the car there I do struggle more than some.;Jenson Button;car
To understand the intensity of driving an F1 car, you have to be in it. When you're driving a 750hp machine at 200mph, the noise and the vibrations are incredible. The G-force when you take big corners is like someone trying to rip your head off. You hit the brakes, and it feels as if the skin is being pulled off your body.;Jenson Button;car
To drive an F1 car you have to be a little mad. On the morning of a race there's a mix of excitement and fear. If it's a wet track, then it's worse as you're not in control most of the time, which is the thing all drivers fear the most.;Jenson Button;car
When I do retire, I know for a fact that I'll never be able to replace the incredible feeling I get when I'm driving an F1 car.;Jenson Button;car
In the car and in front of the camera I tend to be very calm but behind the scenes I can get fired up and passionate, I just don't see the need to shout my mouth off in public.;Jenson Button;car
I don't purposely speed, but I might go over by five or six miles an hour from time to time. It doesn't give me a buzz driving on normal roads, because I can't go fast enough. It's never going to be anything like an F1 car.;Jenson Button;car
The fast, flowing parts, the high-speed corners, that's where a Formula One car is at its best - changes of direction, pulling high g-forces left and right.;Jenson Button;car
A lot of people think Formula One isn't a sport because everyone drives a car when they go to work in the morning. But we're pulling up to six G on a corner or during breaking, which is almost like being a fighter pilot. So we have to do a lot of work on our neck muscles.;Jenson Button;car
I keep my weight low, although you need to be able to move your weight around the race car to change the balance. I'm 6ft and I'm 70kg so I haven't much fat on me.;Jenson Button;car
You're pulling 4-5G for a lot of the corners around the lap. We build up lactic acid because there are a lot of vibrations in the car, and you have to have strong legs to hit the brake pedal. We need to be fit to do every lap at 100%.;Jenson Button;car
When you're doing a TV show, it's not like you just shoot for six weeks and you're in an editing room with all of your footage. It's like a guitar or a car, you have to fine tune things. You stop doing what's not working, you work on what is working and you add things that do work.;Chris Pratt;car
Television is such an evolving medium. When you're doing a TV show, it's not like you just shoot for six weeks and you're in an editing room with all of your footage. It's like a guitar or a car, you have to fine tune things. You stop doing what's not working, you work on what is working and you add things that do work.;Chris Pratt;car
If your goal is to be the biggest movie star in the world, a 10-movie contract is gold. It was never my goal. Up until now, I made movies - and I have a nice house, a nice car. I'm fortunate, happy and grateful. Life is good.;Chris Evans;car
It's that I don't like white paper backgrounds. A woman does not live in front of white paper. She lives on the street, in a motor car, in a hotel room.;Helmut Newton;car
Most of us would never consider getting our car repaired without first receiving an estimate of the charges, but this is exactly what we do when we need to go to a hospital for treatment.;Dan Lipinski;car
My very best friend died in a car accident when I was 16 years old. That was the hardest blow emotionally that I have ever had to endure. Suddenly, you realize tomorrow might not come. Now I live by the motto, 'Today is what I have.';Amber Heard;car
I grew up in Texas, and people love their American-made muscle cars there. I grew up around people who loved cars and took care of cars and my dad's a big car nut, so I learned a little bit about cars - how to love them, most importantly. I think that from the time I could remember, I've always envisioned myself in a vintage muscle car.;Amber Heard;car
We talked about many issues, like welfare, is it the way of life or hand up? Talked about size of government, how much should it tax families and small businesses? And when we left that lunch, we got in the car and I looked over at Chuck and said, 'I'll be damned. we're Republicans.';Susana Martinez;car
Sometimes I feel like I'm not only the engine but the caboose. I have to be in the front car and pull forward, and at the same time run around behind and push everybody along with me.;Sandra Lee;car
That's what I love. Not being interrupted, sitting in a car by myself and listening to music in the rain. There are so many great songs yet to sing.;Alison Krauss;car
I know I will die in a car crash.;Katie Price;car
I married a pretty famous girl, and when we drive through town there's usually a car following us, when I walk out of my front door in Chelsea there's six guys waiting for me.;Kevin Pietersen;car
I've tried everything other than jumping out of a plane, but nothing gives you an adrenaline rush like racing a car.;Nigel Mansell;car
I take cabs if I need to get somewhere or I take car service. I don't drive, I wouldn't mind riding a bike... People think that because you become an entertainer you gotta have this rock star thug image. I'm an artist, man. I'm going to live like an artist.;ASAP Rocky;car
The energy of the crowd is insane. Twenty thousand people. It's the biggest jolt of adrenaline. It's very hard to explain. You know the old story about the woman lifting the car off her kid? It's in that realm. You can actually hurt yourself and not know it.;Tom Petty;car
The first time I rode a bike I was four or five. I crashed into the back of a car.;David Millar;car
If one's honest about it, spending time in a car with children is pretty ghastly.;Arabella Weir;car
I lived on the top of one hill and the school was at the top of another hill. Nobody ever went to school by car - we didn't have any cars during the war. So that to and from school was itself a training.;Roger Bannister;car
It's a tricky place, especially the last sector. I wasn't happy in practice. I wasn't happy with the car and I wasn't happy with myself. But I always thought there was more in the car.;Sebastian Vettel;car
Qualifying is all about putting everything that you have and that the car has in one lap. It's like a rush, I really enjoy that.;Sebastian Vettel;car
All in all it was a smooth race, the car was very well balanced. I'm very proud to be the first winner here in India.;Sebastian Vettel;car
There is no secret, once we go to qualifying, we all seem to enjoy it. Qualifying is all about putting everything that you have and that the car has in one lap. It's like a rush, I really enjoy that.;Sebastian Vettel;car
When you walk the track and you see a corner and realise you were going round it at 160mph, you wonder who could be so stupid to take a corner at that speed. But in the car, you don't even think about that.;Sebastian Vettel;car
Simply racing a Formula 1 car is an achievement.;Sebastian Vettel;car
We always kept believing in ourselves and our team and the car.;Sebastian Vettel;car
I could never drive in a great big car people like me because I'm a man of the people, a hustler.;Terry McAuliffe;car
Life's too short when you find yourself sitting in a car for four hours every day trying to get from East L.A. to West L.A. to Hollywood and then back to East L.A.;Garrett Hedlund;car
I was an economics major in college, and every summer after school, I would drive my car from California, from Claremont men's college at the time, to New York. And I worked on Wall Street.;Henry Kravis;car
Divorced men are more likely to meet their car payments than their child support obligations.;Susan Faludi;car
I'm carded for R-rated movies. And I get talked down to a lot. When I try to go rent a car or buy an airplane ticket or other stuff adults do, I get 'Okaaaaaay, honey.' I remember when I was 18, getting crayons in a restaurant.;Kristen Bell;car
When I climb into my car, I enter my destination into a GPS device, whose spatial memory supplants my own. I have photographs to store the images I want to remember, books to store knowledge and now, thanks to Google, I rarely have to remember anything more than the right set of search terms to access humankind's collective memory.;Joshua Foer;car
I own stock, and I also insure my car with Geico.;Ernie Banks;car
My next adventure will be being in a car with Mischa at the wheel.;Rachel Bilson;car
A few years ago I was at a party and this guy threw me over his shoulder, ran across the street, put me in his car, and stuck his tongue in my mouth.;Rachel Bilson;car
People go to car races to watch the crashes.;Johnny Knoxville;car
Everybody has a gun in their car in Detroit.;Jim Harrison;car
A woman is gentle, soft, delicate, and a man's position is to protect her, help her up stairs, make sure she's in the car safely first. Take good care of your woman, and the sky's the limit!;Taraji P. Henson;car
I'm a crazy car guy. I've got an airplane hangar full of cars.;Paul Walker;car
You know, if you're Guy Kawasaki and you create a car that gets 500 miles a gallon with zero emissions, people on the Internet would say: 'I could have done that in half an hour, and it's been done before. What's the big deal? I expected something more from him.' Meanwhile, they didn't do it, right? They're still living at home with their mothers.;Guy Kawasaki;car
We should tell our kids to just have fun, participate and not get bent on winning or losing. But every coach, when they say that, they say it tongue in cheek, 'Don't worry about winning': If you win I'll get you ice cream, but if you lose I'm going to pout in the car.;Bode Miller;car
It's so funny looking back, but my so-called overnight success actually took 15 years. I remember when I didn't have any money, and my only car was mom's Hyundai.;Criss Angel;car
I have mentally overcome situations most of you would be terrified to ever attempt: heights, fire, needles, spiders, snakes, angry monkeys, being shot, being hit by a car, going blind - you name it, I have been in a situation where I have had to mentally overcome my inherent fears to do my job.;Criss Angel;car
I'm starting to think about things that I want to do, things that are fun. One of them is driving a car like a Porsche. I've driven a lot of cars - sedans, trucks and big family vehicles all year long. But there's nothing like a four-wheel-drive Porsche.;Kevin O'Leary;car
I drank a lot when I was a teenager and I don't drink any more, because that's when I thought, you know, I'm gonna end up a car wreck.;Kristin Davis;car
I'm a big potato chip girl. I don't like chocolate and cakes and all that, but I have to have my potato chips. I've got bags in the back of my car right now! But I never beat myself up about it, because, look: You can't give up every damn thing. You need something in your life that you like just because you like it!;NeNe Leakes;car
I've always been an avid reader. If I don't have a book in the car, I'll stop and pick one up just to have something to read. I don't even remember learning to read.;Janis Ian;car
My work is more about trying to ask good questions and not trying to come up with big shows. Every fashion company is doing that, every car company is doing that.;Laurie Anderson;car
Every song has a composer, every book has an author, every car has a maker, every painting has a painter, and every building has a builder. So it isn't irrational to take this simple logic a little further and say that nature must have had a Maker. It would be irrational to believe that it made itself.;Ray Comfort;car
Here's the thing that I think about life - if you manage to get into a space where you don't need that much, where the overhead of your life is not that great and you're pretty happy and relaxed without that much stuff, you are really liberated because you never have to say yes to something because you want another refrigerator or car!;Brit Marling;car
The biggest thrill a ballplayer can have is when your son takes after you. That happened when my Bobby was in his championship Little League game. He really showed me something. Struck out three times. Made an error that lost the game. Parents were throwing things at our car and swearing at us as we drove off. Gosh, I was proud.;Bob Uecker;car
I'd like to have the flying car, I think that'd be really cool.;Rupert Grint;car
Anyone can write a story based on the kind of horror where you see a guy in car and then there's the bad guy in the back seat. It's infantile to rely on that for telling a story. That's like going to bed and thinking there's a monster under your bed. It's silly.;Sergio Aragones;car
I always loved music. You know, my parents said I started singing when I was 4, in the car.;Bob Seger;car
I think fear is what keeps us from going over the edge. I mean, as a race car driver, I don't think what makes a good race car driver is a fearless person. I think it's somebody that is comfortable being behind the wheel of something that's somewhat out of control.;Jeff Gordon;car
I really enjoy not getting in a car and running errands on bikes.;Stone Gossard;car
To say that I am organized is an understatement, but my car tells a different story.;Emily Procter;car
I lived in small town out in the desert and my friend used to steal his mom's car in the middle of the night. He'd drive over to my house, I'd sneak out and we'd go out to the desert and just burn things down.;Mark Hoppus;car
So, I remember when I was a kid, I was waiting for my mom to come home when she was working late, and, you know, I was like, 'Oh my God, what happened to her? Is she OK? Did something happen to her getting in the car?' I was a little kid. But those are actually early onsets of anxiety.;Vinny Guadagnino;car
On my job I end up jumping out of planes. Last week I got in an 18-wheeler and drove down a runway onto a skid track. The week before that they put me in a car and sunk me to the bottom of a lake to see if I could escape without an oxygen tank.;Rick Mercer;car
In L.A., I don't really want to go out because traffic sucks so bad. I'm sorry, I'm not going to spend five hours a day in my car, so you have to choose where you live very carefully.;Holly Madison;car
I quit after a bad car accident. The thing about boxing is that you can be a star for five or six years, but when you go back to the old life, it's tough.;Olivier Martinez;car
A lot of the songs start with an image. I was sitting there playing the guitar and I pictured this old, dirty green car, with the window rolled down, in the hot, hot, hot Texas heat, and this beautiful woman I knew when I was a kid sitting behind the wheel, looking out at me.;Edie Brickell;car
I hate modern car radios. In my car, I don't even have a push-button radio. It's just got a dial and two knobs. Just AM. One knob makes it louder, and one knob changes the station. When you're driving, that's all I want.;Chris Isaak;car
I once went to one of those parties where everyone throws their car keys into the middle of the room. I don't know who got my moped, but I drove that Peugeot for years.;Victoria Wood;car
Come rain or shine I walk short distances rather than taking my car.;Sophie Ellis-Bextor;car
I think the Smart Car is awesome. The only problem is I've been on the freeway and felt like I was going to be blown away like a Tim Hortons coffee cup, so I may have to upgrade to a Mini Cooper - something a little stronger.;Ellen Page;car
The way you continue to be a successful business is you don't wait for the car to go off the cliff. You have to manage yourself. And make sure you do it in the right way so you are not making decisions in crisis.;Roger Goodell;car
We each own one car, and we have a reasonable house. It's a lovely place to be, but it's not extravagant.;Reese Witherspoon;car
As soon as I began to earn what might be called fairly large sums, I bought a car and began to explore the country around New York.;Kate Smith;car
If you saw a dog going to be crushed under a car, wouldn't you help him?;Oskar Schindler;car
One thing that worried me was how writers get categorized and so they end up having to write the same kind of book again and again. That is fine if it is what you want to do, but I would rather be locked in the trunk of my car with a weasel than write the same book every three years until I die.;Justin Cronin;car
I've worked as a labourer, driven taxis and school buses, and been a car mechanic - whatever I could do just to get by. But it does mean that I know a little bit about a lot of things.;Cory Monteith;car
What I enjoy doing more than anything is, I have my little antique car collection, and when the weather is pretty I like to get out one of my old cars. I have a little route I run down in the country, down Nachez Trace Parkway. The loop down through there is just really relaxing, not much traffic.;Alan Jackson;car
I am a horrible visual artist. I can't fix a car, sew, knit, cook, etc. Statistically, there is more I don't do than do.;Carrie Brownstein;car
The word 'geek' today does not mean what it used to mean. A geek isn't the skinny kid with a pocket protector and acne. There can be computer geeks, video game geeks, car geeks, military geeks, and sports geeks. Being a geek just means that you're passionate about something.;Olivia Munn;car
A geek isn't the skinny kid with a pocket protector and acne. There can be computer geeks, video game geeks, car geeks, military geeks, and sports geeks. Being a geek just means that you're passionate about something.;Olivia Munn;car
In the heat of the Russian summer a sleeping car is the most horrible instrument of martyrdom imaginable.;Manfred von Richthofen;car
When I grew up there wasn't air-conditioning or anything of that nature, and this old car had a wall thickness of about ten inches. So we had a little warmer house in the winter and a little cooler in the summer.;Merle Haggard;car
It sounds like something from a Woody Guthrie song, but it's true I was raised in a freight car.;Merle Haggard;car
There were times when I thought I would never own a car.;Victor Cruz;car
The image is where you have dinner at night, who you're seeing. It's what car you drive and how you dress. People in the industry sell that, and it creates a dream. There's nothing else.;Elle Macpherson;car
I'm the one who gets called up about a problem. I'm the one who gets called up about the street lighting and the abandoned car. I'm the one who gets blamed if the police don't arrive. I'm the one they blame if a city truck is broken down.;Richard M. Daley;car
You know, it's amazing. I don't even have a car, would you believe it? I had a motorbike and it got stolen last year. So I've got to buy another one of those, I suppose. I can treat myself to that.;Michael Fassbender;car

I've made movies that cost less than one car chase.;Sam Mendes;car
In 1950, when the Giants signed me, they gave me $15,000. I bought a 1950 Mercury. I couldn't drive, but I had it in the parking lot there, and everybody that could drive would drive the car. So it was like a community thing.;Willie Mays;car
Some people think my father was a spy, because of working for that government agency in Vietnam, but he can't find his car keys, much less keep a national secret.;Lauren Graham;car

It's not a case of 'look at me in my car' it's more, 'look at the car'. I like the idea of other people enjoying them, because everything has become a bit faceless and nobody likes the motor car any more.;Jay Kay;car
I didn't get my first car until I was 22. It was a BMW 1602 and now I've got it back I'm waiting to restore it.;Jay Kay;car

The United Nations four or five years ago put out a study that said the meat industry, meat-eating, growing meat for food is the No. 1 killer of our planet - not No. 2 or No. 3: No 1. You know what's No. 2? Transportation. Everyone thinks that No. 1 is transportation, and goes out and buys a hybrid car. Screw the hybrid cars. Don't eat hamburgers.;Maggie Q;car
You cannot expect the guy who drove the car into the ditch to navigate it out of the ditch. You have to put a new driver in the seat. I'm not saying the new driver is going to be any better, but we need a new driver. Kerry is the only choice.;John Mellencamp;car
The idea that maybe you don't have to own a car if you only need one occasionally may catch on, just like time-sharing caught on in real estate.;Steve Case;car

I took guitar a while back, and my heart wasn't in it at the time, but I'm ready to try it again. I sing in the car, at home - it's a huge part of my life, especially since I'm from Tennessee.;Lucy Hale;car
I love Lady Antebellum and Miranda Lambert - they write from the heart. But it's hard to find a country music lover in L.A. None of my friends really listen to it, and they hate getting in the car with me because I just blast Taylor Swift.;Lucy Hale;car
I definitely love that all these car brands are coming out with hybrid forms of every car that they have. It's very awesome because I think it does make a difference, and it doesn't hurt that you save a lot of money on gas.;Lucy Hale;car
I've always had an affinity and a passion for cars and that whole car culture.;Ludacris;car
Paul is Starsky, and I met him before shooting. He was very kind and encouraged us to go with what we wanted to do. It was very sweet to see them back with the car after 25 years.;Ben Stiller;car

When I was in New York, I was making a living. We had a summer house and a car that I could put in a garage. That's something for a stage actor.;William H. Macy;car
Your car should drive itself. It's amazing to me that we let humans drive cars... It's a bug that cars were invented before computers.;Eric Schmidt;car
Consider the perverse effect cap and trade has on altruistic actions. Say you decide to buy a small, high-efficiency car. That reduces your emissions, but not your country's. Instead it allows somebody else to buy a bigger S.U.V. - because the total emissions are set by the cap.;James Hansen;car
Every summer my husband and I pack our suitcases, load our kids into the car, and drive from tense, crowded New York City to my family's cottage in Maine.

The ought to be a worldwide cultural taskforce that just stops you when you have ideas like combining The Red Desert with an armored car heist movie.;Steven Soderbergh;car
Well, it is so difficult right now when you look out on the road and how fast people go and the more and more cars you see out there, for teenagers, you'd think a kid that literally, a few years before, was sitting back in a car seat in the back seat is now behind the wheel.;Amy Klobuchar;car
But I also like to shower my parents with presents. I bought them a beautiful car and a house.;Eva Herzigova;car

Going to car racing school was phenomenal.;Michelle Rodriguez;car
A gun can be dangerous. But a gun can protect you, you can hunt for food with it - you know, the tool itself is a tool. The intention of the party using the tool is a part of the process, right? You know: the knife cuts the steak, stabs the person, saves somebody from danger, cuts somebody out of a car.;Peter Guber;car
I've made club songs, and I've made radio songs, and I've made the car songs.;T-Pain;car
My first car was an '84 Ford Taurus. It caught on fire from me trying to change the fuel pump, so that wasn't good at all. Dried leaves on the ground while I was trying to change the fuel pump. Don't do that. Do it on concrete.;T-Pain;car
We need a number of solutions - we need more efficiency and conservation. Efficiency is a big one. I think car companies need to do a lot better in producing more efficient cars. They have the technology, we just need to demand them as consumers.;Daryl Hannah;car
Twenty years ago, I was living in a lovely cottage on the edge of Dartmoor but I couldn't afford to run a car.;Mary Wesley;car

The day I won an Emmy was also the day my father passed away. I received a call from my sister on the way to the ceremony and had to turn my car around and catch the first flight back to Karachi.;Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy;car
Because of that I don't care when I read in the newspaper that I am colourblind. I went through a red light in my car and I stopped when I before a green light. So I must be really colourblind, eh?;Ruud van Nistelrooy;car
The courts cannot garnish a father's salary, nor freeze his account, nor seize his property on behalf of his children, in our society. Apparently this is because a kid is not a car or a couch or a boat.;June Jordan;car
Mayors could never get away with the kind of nonsense that goes on in Washington. In our world, you either picked up the trash or you didn't. You either moved an abandoned car or you didn't. You either filled a pothole or you didn't. That's what we do every day. And we know how to get this stuff done.;Michael Nutter;car
The negative effects of combat were nightmares, and I'd get jumpy around certain noises and stuff, but you'd have that after a car accident or a bad divorce. Life's filled with trauma. You don't need to go to war to find it it's going to find you. We all deal with it, and the effects go away after awhile. At least they did for me.;Sebastian Junger;car
In college, my big money memory was saving up to buy a car with my boyfriend, whom I lived with.;Christie Hefner;car
I think I'm pretty smart on what I spend my money on. I still don't have a new car, I drive my old car that I've had forever. But I bought a house in downtown Chicago.;Chris O'Donnell;car

Because I'm a young black man driving a really nice, expensive car, I sometimes get harassed when I'm rolling through a ghetto neighbourhood.;Coolio;car

There are going to be little victories that we claim, even if it's finishing 15th and putting the car back in hauler without a scratch on it.;Kurt Busch;car
This is like my dad's race team where we had one Legend car. If we wrecked it, we couldn't race the next week unless we had enough parts to put it back together again.;Kurt Busch;car

It's just that fun atmosphere, working on the car, being with the guys. This is exactly what I needed.;Kurt Busch;car

People spend so much time in their cars, and it's a legal way to have fun by speeding a little bit or testing yourself a little bit, and you get to invest in your car. For some people, it becomes their baby.;Jordana Brewster;car
In sport there is never any moment that is the same as the other. I have been in Formula One for 12 years, and out of that I had one year with the perfect car.;Michael Schumacher;car
I knew that by getting behind the wheel of the car and having had something to drink, the responsibility laid on my shoulders.;Tracey Gold;car
I remember that all of a sudden, the car felt like I couldn't control it. It was absolutely the most horrifying experience. We rolled over, off the freeway. I think there was something wrong with the car.;Tracey Gold;car
I will never have a drink and get behind the wheel of a car. It's not illegal to drink and drive, but there becomes a certain point where it does become a crime.;Tracey Gold;car
I never listen to music in the house, I listen to music in the car.;Peter Tork;car
Investors have few spare tires left. Think of the image of a car on a bumpy road to an uncertain destination that has already used up its spare tire. The cash reserves of people have been eaten up by the recent market volatility.;Mohamed El-Erian;car
Now having said that, I realize that releasing a film in the real world is like trying to get General Motors to release a handmade car.;Godfrey Reggio;car
On the average, I don't spend more than 15 minutes in the car - to go to the golf course or the gym. And that's the only time I listen to the radio.;Dweezil Zappa;car
Eventually I did that, but it took a lot of twists and turns, and there were a year or two there where I was living with no money at all - no home, no car, no nothing. I was living in somebody's garage in Los Angeles at that point - for a year.;Renny Harlin;car
I could be on 52nd and Third in Manhattan up and ask a strange for directions and they will help you, that's a rural heart.

If I test the car for a year I can be quite competitive the next season.;Valentino Rossi;car

It used to be that you'd have a song recorded by a major country artist and if it was a hit, you could buy a car. Now you can buy a dealership.;Tom T. Hall;car
When I finish an album and I find myself listening to it in the car, because it makes me feel a certain way, that's the time to try to let other people know about it.;Herb Alpert;car

I did a lot of gasoline commercials - Hess, Texaco. I was part of the family in the car, the little brat in the back.;Ricky Schroder;car

The thing about drugs and sex is that you lose all your inhibitions. I've had sex in trains, planes, wine bars... and quite a few car parks!;Robbie Williams;car

I think, like everybody else in New Hampshire, when I pull up to fill up my car and I pay $50, I get upset. And I'm wondering if these prices are legitimate.;Judd Gregg;car
I was in prison for a charge in Texas, murder one. Back in the '70s in Texas, I was there. I heard the shot. I was in the car.;Duane Chapman;car
Faith is the substance of hope - of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen.

I'm gonna be the best dad that ever lived. I'll have a ranch with a race car track and a golf course.;Jeremy London;car

I remember my wife and I used to get on plane and see everybody else with their babies. They'd be putting strollers and car seats up above, and we'd think: Oh, please Lord, don't make us go through that.;Paul Reiser;car
I think there's a suspicion in the South of people putting on airs. You see it in most successful Southern politicians, but you also see it in someone like Richard Petty, who may be a multimillionaire stock car driver, but he's also beloved because he has a nice self-deprecatory way about him.;John Shelton Reed;car
Is there some risk every day we walk out our front door? Every time we get in our car? Yeah. Are we materially less safe now than we were 10 years ago? Whatever delta there is, it's very small.;John Hickenlooper;car
It bothers me when I hear it in a car commercial or some such. But for the most part, it's better than seeing sacred music relegated to the scrap heap.;Richard Morris;car
The will is never free - it is always attached to an object, a purpose. It is simply the engine in the car - it can't steer.;Joyce Cary;car
I just completed a tour in Europe. I played every night. This requires traveling some days for six hours in a van or a train or a car. After six weeks of that, I checked into the hotel and just fell apart.;Lee Konitz;car
People would say you look weak if you're not cursing the opposition and driving around in a big black car while always wearing a tie. Above all, to be 'strong' you're always supposed to be giving orders.;Georgios A. Papandreou;car
If you or me go to the gas station to fill up our car and it costs us much more than we expected, it will zap our discretionary income. We won't have the extra money to buy that washing machine or new winter coat-all big ticket items that are important to economic growth.;Maria Bartiromo;car

If I start outsourcing all my navigation to a little talking box in my car, I'm sort of screwed. I'm going to lose my car in the parking lot every single time.;Ken Jennings;car
I think that people don't know how to do anything anymore. My father was a janitor. He could take a car apart and put it back together. He could build a house in the back yard. Today, if you ask people what they know, they say, 'I know how to hire someone.';Walter Mosley;car
I mean, you have a general tone of it but it's pretty much you get to come in and you're going to flip this car and it's going to blow up and you're going to come out on fire and you go oh, that's cool, and then you get paid a lot of money.;David R. Ellis;car
No, in Lethal Weapon I was a taxi cab driver that Mel jumps in front of the taxi and pulls me out of the car and steals the taxi. Then I did some other indie driving for some of the car sequences.;David R. Ellis;car

I really like listening to music in my car.;Aaron Neville;car
There are races and then there are races. And without a doubt, the Indy 500 is the race that I've always wanted to attend. And now, to be driving the Corvette Pace Car... this is going to be unbelievable.;Guy Fieri;car
It was all that stuff about taking your parents' car when you're 13, sneaking booze into rock shows and ditching school with your friends. I could relate to that as a former teenager, rather than as a present parent.;Donal Logue;car

The first trip I remember taking was on the train from Virginia up to New York City, watching the summertime countryside rolling past the window. They used white linen tablecloths in the dining car in those days, and real silver. I love trains to this day. Maybe that was the beginning of my fixation with leisurely modes of travel.;Billy Campbell;car
I am very puzzled by the fact that young people are getting infected again. They don't take precautions despite an enormous amount of information. It's like riding a race car at 200 kilometers an hour. Some people like the risk.;Luc Montagnier;car
I listen to KCRW in the car and Pandora radio, which I stream through the stereo from my iPhone. I've been listening to everything from Caribou to Conway Twitty. If I'm going on a longer car ride, I'll download some podcasts.;Sam Trammell;car

In the end I didn't get a top car any more. I had no toughness left. That was the reality.;Jacky Ickx;car

It's not just the kid who's spent every penny from his job to upgrade his car to tell the world he cares about sports cars, it's also the person driving around in a fuel-conscious hybrid electric car, because it's more a message to the world than an effective means of saving fuel, to be quite honest.;Richard Hammond;car
I've been in a car three or four times when it filled with water and it's not a comfortable feeling.;Richard Hammond;car

As far as luxury goes, about the only thing I do is... I go first class all the way. I live on the road, so when I'm out there, I'm getting the nice hotel suite, I'm getting the luxury car, I'm eating the good food, and I make sure I take care of myself on the road.;Trish Stratus;car

Accidents happen, whether they're car accidents, friendly fire, drug overdoses. Accidents happen, and they're tragic.

The fact is that a car used by Gerry Adams and myself during the course of the Mitchell review was bugged by elements within British military intelligence.;Martin McGuinness;car

I grew up where my parents would literally shove me in the car rather than have to say hello to a neighbor.;Amy Sherman-Palladino;car

Whenever I drive under a yellow light, I always kiss my finger and tap it on the roof of the car.;Jared Padalecki;car

That's when it really came together for me that I was in a Bond film, to have my own spy car!;Rick Yune;car

Especially in the car ride to and from gym. I find myself spacing out a lot, just visualizing what the Olympics would be like and just having such great role models.;Aly Raisman;car

The preparation, commitment and desire to win will be no less than the last time I drove a grand prix car in anger.;Nigel Mansell;car
It's sad that women characters have lost so much ground in popular movies. Didn't 'Thelma and Louise' prove that women want to see women doing things on film? Thelma and Louise were in a classic car they were being chased by cops they shot up a truck - and women loved it.;Robin Quivers;car
The very first time I was on a car in Atlanta, I saw the conductor - all conductors are white - ask a Negro woman to get up and take a seat farther back in order to make a place for a white man. I have also seen white men requested to leave the Negro section of the car.;Ray Stannard Baker;car

See, what you're meant to do when you have a mid-life crisis is buy a fast car, aren't you? Well, I've always had fast cars. It's not that. It's the fear that you're past your best. It's the fear that the stuff you've done in the past is your best work.;Robbie Coltraine;car

Then as everything, like I say, things started to come together, when things started to go our way, that's when you results started to come. I was no different driver. I was certainly learning every time I went in the car.;Dan Wheldon;car

I've still got that little freedom part of me that wants to have a car that looks really sexy.;Patrice O'Neal;car

'Blind Curve,' the book I'm working on now, sprang from a crazy incident that happened to me last year while on my book tour.

Except in my story, the hero doesn't get off as easily as I did.;Andrew Gross;car

The trick at Le Mans is to get the car 'in the window.'

I like to sing in the car with the windows rolled down and hair blowing all over my face.;Lauren Alaina;car

On one level, nothing's really changed in my life. I still drive my daughter in the car pool on Monday.

I worked for this company that repossessed cars. Sure enough, the day after I quit, they repossessed my car, but that would probably be my strangest job to date. You have to work your way up to become a hardcore repo man.;Romany Malco;car
I sing both in my shower and in my car, mostly in my car, because I have this weird thing - whenever I'm singing to the radio - my friends kind of hate it - but I pick out the harmonies in my head, and I'm singing the harmonies to the tracks and I'm jamming it out.;Paul McDonald;car
I remember when I started off, my first car was a Kia Spectra. With a spoiler kit and some rims.;Gio Gonzalez;car

Get in the race car do what I do then go home. We don't have freedom to do anything anymore.;Tony Stewart;car

I would not change my blest estate for all the world calls good or great.;Isaac Watts;change
Girls are taught to sing high and pretty, like Antony, not low and from the guts like Nina Simone. But we're slowly trying to change that.

In science the important thing is to modify and change one's ideas as science advances.;Herbert Spencer;change

What that change might be Roosevelt never clearly said, probably because he himself didn't know.;Russell Baker;change
Women have a lot of power in private life. There are many men who would say, 'Hey, women already rule my life.' But with women, more is more. The more there are, the more the world gets used to seeing them. We change the culture. We begin to expand options and lead and manage.;Dee Dee Myers;change
The fight is always the same within the Democratic Party, isn't it? The more things change, the more they stay the same.;Dee Dee Myers;change
Washington is still very much a male-oriented culture. Being from Los Angeles, I think it is less so there - there is less attachment to tradition, perhaps, there is more flexibility, more acceptance of change generally. That is partly because of Hollywood.;Dee Dee Myers;change
When I joined Bill Clinton's start-up presidential campaign in 1991, I was confident that women would play an ever more important role, but I never gave a minute's thought to what would happen if we won.

Man has a limited biological capacity for change. When this capacity is overwhelmed, the capacity is in future shock.;Alvin Toffler;change
Some argue that now isn't the time to push the green agenda - that all efforts should be on preventing a serious recession. That is a false choice.

It is tragic that people who are incarcerated are unable to vote. They are probably the most important voices to listen to because they can tell us what we need to change.;Margaret Cho;change
It is not strange... to mistake change for progress.;Millard Fillmore;change
A zebra does not change its spots.;Al Gore;change

When you go off in the world and make your life, and you come back to your home town, and you find your old high-school friends driving in the same circles, doing the same things, that's what Hollywood's like.

Despite the fact that in America we incarcerate more juveniles for life terms than in any other country in the world, the truth is that the vast majority of youth offenders will one day be released.

Change is one of my favourite words.;Carol Vorderman;change
I have to change a lot of things before I become a good marathon runner.;Haile Gebrselassie;change

I don't think the Palestinian people or Afghan children or some other things I'm concerned about are at the top of other people's agendas - not right now, when America is going through such a recession and people are suffering across the board financially. But I think all that will change.;Patti Smith;change
One of the big questions in the climate change debate: Are humans any smarter than frogs in a pot? If you put a frog in a pot and slowly turn up the heat, it won't jump out. Instead, it will enjoy the nice warm bath until it is cooked to death. We humans seem to be doing pretty much the same thing.;Jeff Goodell;change
I've always looked the same. Since I was a child, I hated having to deal with my hair. I hated having to change my clothes. As a kid, I had a sailor shirt and the same old corduroy pants, and that's what I wanted to wear everyday.;Patti Smith;change
You may not be able to change a situation, but with humor you can change your attitude about it.;Allen Klein;change

The experience of being in space didn't change my perspective of myself or of the planet or of life. I had no spiritual experience.;Sally Ride;change

As somebody who, in my second marriage, insisted on a prenuptial agreement, I can also testify that sometimes it is an act of love to chart the exit strategy before you enter the union, in order to make sure that not only you, but your partner as well, knows that there will be no World War III should hearts and minds, for any sad reason, change.;Elizabeth Gilbert;change

President Obama has a pretty good track record of this.;Eliot Spitzer;change

We are like a woman with a difficult pregnancy. We have to rebuild the social classes in Egypt, and we must change the way things were.;Naguib Mahfouz;change
On the political front, of course it's a zero-sum game. If it's all white males holding positions, you bring 10 women in, then it's, 'Women are coming!' Get 10 blacks and it's, 'Blacks are coming!' 'Hispanics are coming!' Zero-sum game. The seatmates might change but the chairs don't move. In the economy, the number of chairs can actually increase.;Jesse Jackson;change

I think I can change the game.;Venus Williams;change

I was born left-handed, but I was made to use my other hand. When I was writing 'Famished Road,' which was very long, I got repetitive stress syndrome.

Much can and must be done by governments, but they cannot of themselves change lives.;Jonathan Sacks;change

When I launched the development of the GNU system, I explicitly said the purpose of developing this system is so we can use our computers and have freedom, thus if you use some other free system instead but you have freedom, then it's a success. It's not popularity for our code but it's success for our goal.;Richard Stallman;computers
The great advance of personal computers was not the computing power per se but the fact that it brought it right to your face, that you had control over it, that were confronted with it and could steer it.;Kevin Kelly;computers
I'm a very simple person. I don't use computers.;Carrie-Anne Moss;computers

There's all these ways to instantly communicate - cars, computers, telephone and transportation - and even with all that, it's so hard to find people and have an honest communication with them.;Jason Schwartzman;computers
I'm really anti-option, so computers have been my nightmare with recording. I don't want endless tracks I want less tracks. I want decisions to be made.;Ian MacKaye;computers
I was a 'Duck Hunt' and 'Mario' guy, and stuff like that. I was never technologically driven. I never had all the cool, new toys. I was the youngest child, I wasn't the only child, so I wasn't spoiled as a kid. And, we were on the farm, so we didn't have a lot. Also, with computers, I'm not very good with them. I just check my email.;Garrett Hedlund;computers
We're just into toys, whether it's motorcycles or race cars or computers. I've got the Palm Pilot right here with me, I've got the world's smallest phone. Maybe it's just because I'm still a big little kid and I just love toys, you know?;Catherine Bell;computers

You have to wait for people to program you. The only difference is the amount of people that you're going to reach but that's going to even out in the next two or three years anyway. Computers are being bought faster than televisions right now.;Chuck D.;computers
To me, there is something superbly symbolic in the fact that an astronaut, sent up as assistant to a series of computers, found that he worked more accurately and more intelligently than they. Inside the capsule, man is still in charge.;Adlai Stevenson;computers
One of the problems with computers, particularly for the older people, is they were befuddled by them, and the computers have gotten better. They have gotten easier to use. They have gotten less expensive. The software interfaces have made things a lot more accessible.;Steve Case;computers
One of the biggest challenges we had in the first decade was not that many people had personal computers. There weren't that many people to sell to, and it was hard to identify them.;Steve Case;computers

Computers, like automobiles and airplanes, do only what people tell them to do.;Bill James;computers
I've never had Internet access. Actually, I have looked at things on other people's computers as a bystander. A few times in my life I've opened email accounts, twice actually, but it's something I don't want in my life right now.;Jhumpa Lahiri;computers
It was a huge challenge to learn digital painting well enough so that computers don't pop into mind when one sees one.;Berkeley Breathed;computers

One of the things that is not so good is that a decision was made long ago about the size of an IP address - 32 bits. At the time it was a number much larger than anyone could imagine ever having that many computers but it turned out to be to small.;Jon Postel;computers
China has legally purchased high performance computers, advanced machine tools, and semiconductor-manufacturing equipment from several American companies.;Charles Foster Bass;computers

I don't look at computers as opponents. For me it is much more interesting to beat humans.;Magnus Carlsen;computers
I've never been much of a computer guy at least in terms of playing with computers. Actually until I was about 11 I didn't use a computer for preparing for games at all. I was playing a bit online, was using the chess club mainly. Now, obviously, the computer is an important tool for me preparing for my games.;Magnus Carlsen;computers
Well, the big products in electronics in the '50s were radio and television. The first big computers were just beginning to come in and represented the most logical market for us to work in.;Jack Kilby;computers

Theaters are always going to be around, and doing fine. With computers and technology, we're becoming more and more secluded from each other.

I'm friends with a lot of my exes, but it took time. We didn't just get into it. I don't think you can be friends until you're cool with them dating someone else. That's when you know.;Rashida Jones;cool
A lot of pop people out there are cool, but they overdo it.;Norah Jones;cool
The pop world is cool, but I never really thought of myself as part of it or wanting to be a part of it because I'm on a label that's not really like that. They're not trying to dress me up, they're not trying to do things like that. I feel like I'm sort of separate from that, actually.;Norah Jones;cool
I could do without 'cool' publications calling me 'mom jazz.' But I laughed all the way to the bank, baby.;Norah Jones;cool
When I entered high school I was an A-student, but not for long. I wanted the fancy clothes. I wanted to hang out with the guys. I went from being an A-student to a B-student to a C-student, but I didn't care. I was getting the high fives and the low fives and the pats on the back. I was cool.;Benjamin Carson;cool
I'm a sappy mom now. I didn't think I would be. I thought I'd be a cool mom who keeps everything in perspective.;Katherine Heigl;cool

I remember once acting really cool on a bus with this girl named Stephanie. When I got home, I realized that I had a really big zit on my forehead. If you have acne problems, you really shouldn't be acting like Don Juan.;John Cusack;cool
I used to be a cool chick but I'm not anymore.;Britney Spears;cool
In the Lamborghini I have to avoid certain roads because of pot holes, and there's nowhere to put my drink, no cup holder. And I'm not going to lie, it looks pretentious. I used to think it was cool to, like, drive it to dinner. Now? Like I really need to be looked at any more.;Danica Patrick;cool
Long intros are cool because there's a little bit of anticipation, you know?;Miranda Lambert;cool
As a kid, I did want to be an old-timer, since they were the ones with the big stories and the cool clothes. I wanted to go there. Now, I guess I want to bring that with me and go back in time.;Tom Waits;cool
My parents used to throw great New Year's Eve parties. They invited such an eclectic mix of showbiz people. All those cool people were always hanging out at our apartment.;Ben Stiller;cool

It was a very cool thing to be a smart girl, as opposed to some other, different kind. And I think that made a great deal of difference to me growing up and in my life afterward.;Elena Kagan;cool
Cynicism is kind of like folding your arms and stepping back and commenting on things, like the old guys in 'The Muppets,' just throwing out comments all the time, whereas there are other people on the ground really trying to affect things and improve their lives and the lives of other people. I think it's noble and I think it's cool.;Josh Radnor;cool
I haven't left the house without a packet of Kleenex in my back pocket for as long as I can remember. Whenever I start thinking I'm incredibly cool, the packet of Kleenex in my back pocket brings me right back down to earth.;Josh Radnor;cool
And of course I've got kids of my own now, and they love me being in the Harry Potter films. I'm now part of a phenomenon. You become incredibly cool to your kids, and you get a young fan base. So you became the cool dad at school. You're suddenly hip.;Gary Oldman;cool
There aren't many poster children for cool angst. Everybody thinks it's cool if you're the bad girl.;Fiona Apple;cool

Now I'm way into suits that I can put on whether I took a shower or not, and wear barefoot and paint my toes black or whatever color the suit is. It's very cool to wear suits like that. Roll up the sleeves and just say yee-haw.;Steven Tyler;cool
How serious can a movie about time-traveling robots be? You want it to be cool and fun.;Christian Bale;cool
I did find some time to go to a record store and check out 'Headstrong' actually in the racks. It was pretty cool I never thought I'd see my own CD sitting there with everyone else's. I made my Mom take lots of pics!;Ashley Tisdale;cool
All I know about thermal pollution is that if we continue our present rate of growth in electrical energy consumption it will simply take, by the year 2000, all our freshwater streams to cool the generators and reactors.;David R. Brower;cool
I haven't took no punishment. There's nothing cool about taking punishment.;Floyd Mayweather, Jr.;cool
Australia is so cool that it's hard to even know where to start describing it. The beaches are beautiful so is the weather. Not too crowded. Great food, great music, really nice people. It must be a lot like Los Angeles was many years ago.;Mary-Kate Olsen;cool
It's cool to be healthy.;Dick Gregory;cool
I don't wanna abandon my identity as LL Cool J, but at the same time, I had to figure out how to let people know that I'm really serious about making these movies.;LL Cool J;cool
What is more important than the name is that people know that I really like acting, I enjoy it and I want people to know that I am serious. The name thing: I will always be L.L. Cool J.;LL Cool J;cool
I'm taking a lot of my favorite artists, different people, my favorite music and marrying that with what I do as a comic. It's very collaborative, arty, fun and cool.;Margaret Cho;cool
The problem to me is violence. It's not cool to kill somebody or hurt people.;Mark Ruffalo;cool

I'm obsessed with the 1920s, everything from the style to the lifestyle. It was a really cool era.;Lauren Conrad;cool
These days it's cool to be ethnic and to be different, but when I was a kid, it was not cool - at all. My friends would come over and my mom would make crepes with eggs, stuffed with mozzarella cheese, tomatoes and spinach. And they'd be like, 'What is this?';Giada De Laurentiis;cool
I think a lot of young kids at school are very conscious of trying to keep credibility in case they kind of stand out in a crowd and get bullied by trying to stay cool and stuff. And my whole thing, all the way through school, was I was just a goof... I didn't care.;Dominic Monaghan;cool
Orlando's a really cool guy. They hired him for 'Lord of the Rings' out of drama school. He's very new at this still and doesn't have a lot of experience. So we were in this together and we've tried to help each other out. We felt very equal which was good.;Diane Kruger;cool
I have a kind of boring personal life, to the paparazzi anyway, and I don't hang with the cool crowd.;Diane Kruger;cool

Survival, in the cool economics of biology, means simply the persistence of one's own genes in the generations to follow.;Lewis Thomas;cool
I've always been scared of advertising folk. I've met them at parties and I've been to their offices and I've always found them intimidatingly cool. At one company I visited, they held their meetings in a caravan that had somehow been installed in the place, a rather more exotic place to gather than the typical BBC glass box.;Evan Davis;cool
I was trying to break out of the suburbs, and when I did break out, I don't think I took my whole self with me - I think I played a role of being too cool and hip.;Liz Phair;cool

I wondered how they would top the Pirates and skeletons and moonlight, because that's a pretty cool concept.;Orlando Bloom;cool
I'm trying to mix the cool, independent stuff with the big stuff, but it's been difficult finding the right roles. It's been an interesting ride as far as my career pendulum is concerned.;Orlando Bloom;cool
The truth is - I found myself doing these huge action-adventure movies, and um, and which are cool man. And I really love doing them. And thankfully I haven't had too much dialogue, because if I had I would have really made a mess of it. You know what I mean?;Orlando Bloom;cool
It's hard to encapsulate my inspiration because there are so many different looks, but I think it's just like, sexy girl you see walking down the street in a cool outfit. A lot of eyelet, a lot of leather, playing with the hard and the soft, the good and bad inside of us all.;Chloe Sevigny;cool
Danger is cool.;Bryan Cranston;cool
I'm finding, as I get older, that I'm not much of a believer in redemption. I mean, I believe in redemption in real life - redemption does happen, and it's cool when it does - but I find myself getting leery of my desire for it in stories (especially my own).;George Saunders;cool
The cool parts - the parts that have won Dubai its reputation as 'the Vegas of the Middle East' or 'the Venice of the Middle East' or 'the Disney World of the Middle East, if Disney World were the size of San Francisco and out in a desert' - have been built in the last ten years.;George Saunders;cool

I read the script for Wonder Boys, and I said that was almost perfect, it was so classy, cool and funny. It's a really specific thing. We stuck to it, it turned out good and a lot of people liked it.;Robert Downey, Jr.;cool
Yeah, my dream would be to work for 6 months and then have 6 months to play, just snowboarding, surfing, and going to cool places to listen and be alone and kinda chill out.;Marc Newson;cool
I would like to do a musical, if I could find a cool one. A song-and-dance role is closer to me personally than other characters I play.;Joseph Gordon-Levitt;cool
I used to love to draw. I didn't want to go to art class because I felt that would be too corny when I was young, but architectural drafting was the cool thing to do because there was more precision. It taught me a lot about building and structures and doorways and frames and windowsills.;Ice Cube;cool
In the summer I wear shorts with a bright top and ankle boots or just sandals. I'll add a nice scarf, maybe a hat, some cool sunglasses. It's all about the accessories.;Alessandra Ambrosio;cool

If I wasn't even famous or had any success, I would still wake up and put tons of make-up on, and put on a cool outfit. That's always been who I've been my whole life, so that's never gonna change. I love fashion. I love getting dressed up. I love Halloween, too.;Gwen Stefani;cool
Hip-hop is still cool at a party. But to me, hip-hop has never been strictly a party it is also there to elevate consciousness.;Saul Williams;cool

You can be cool and at the same time respect your woman, who will hopefully become your wife, who will hopefully become the mother of your kids. America needs to get back to family values.;Martin Lawrence;cool
I think I'm drawn to more villain-type characters, because it's so cool to get to say all the things you want to say. In Hollywood, you get to this position where you have to bite your tongue so much. You take all your experiences of not being able to say what you really want to say, and channel that through your character.;Gabrielle Union;cool
Being cool, having a 'cool' energy is just not attractive to me.;Selena Gomez;cool
No matter how good you are, at some point your kids are gonna have to create their own independence and think that Mom and Dad aren't cool, just to establish themselves. That's what adolescence is about. They're gonna go through that no matter what.;Eddie Vedder;cool
'Sparkle' fell into my lap. I had heard a little bit about it, that it was being redone in early 2011. I was just kind of like, 'Oh, that would be really cool,' and not really thinking too much about it, and then it came through my agency. I read it, I fell in love with the script and I went in to audition.;Jordin Sparks;cool
As far as friendships go, things change even without the fame. People start moving on. I have a few friends that are married and are starting to have kids and I'm like, 'Oh my goodness gracious - that's so insane.' I also have friends who are just doing their own thing, which is cool.;Jordin Sparks;cool
It's cool to have parents and family who will always tell me the truth no matter what. They'll tell me if I'm doing something stupid!;Jordin Sparks;cool
I have the ability to sing with emotion and feeling, but if you say I sound like Billie Holiday, that's cool. Let's look at who Billie was: she was this person, this singer, this beautiful diva who could move the audience with the slightest gesture of her hand.;Erykah Badu;cool
Oh, man, if in real life I was as cool and suave as Coach Taylor and had all the answers, things would be easier.;Kyle Chandler;cool

It was just an idea I had, that it could be cool to have a book covered in fake fur.;Dave Eggers;cool
I'm cool with the way I look, I'm not an ugly dog, but I don't see myself as a stud or anything.;Seann William Scott;cool
I've never been cool and I don't really care about being cool. It's just an awful lot of time and hair gel wasted.;Chris Martin;cool
For my group of friends is Lady Gaga eye-opening? No. She's a less dangerous version of what was so cool about pop culture in the '80s. Back then it was so gay and so punk in so many ways.;Beth Ditto;cool
All this fashion stuff - who's cool now - is just a bigger version of the cool kids versus the nerds.;Beth Ditto;cool
I think it's really cool that there are people like Adele on the cover of 'Vogue' and 'Rolling Stone,' and like I think it's really important that people are talking about your body, because if they don't, then you'll never be able to break that barrier.;Beth Ditto;cool
I think all jocks have a sensitive side. It's just, will they show it to anybody? Will they let their guard down and stop being tough and the cool jock guy around their friends, or just relax? I don't know if it's best to say opening up, but just relax and really say what you're actually thinking, and not what you think people want to hear.;Channing Tatum;cool
Whatever hysteria exists is inflamed by mystery, suspicion and secrecy. Hard and exact facts will cool it.;Elia Kazan;cool
I want to go to college and go back to Georgetown. It's a really cool place.;Bobby Flay;cool
I haven't ever really relied on relationships with guys. They come around and it's cool, but it's never been a big thing. I guess I've just been really distracted by work.;Leighton Meester;cool
If we have a great idea, we'll go, 'Oh, this could be a cool movie.' Or really for us, it's more like, 'Oh, this is a really bad idea. Let's do this. This seems really stupid.';Trey Parker;cool
The ballplayer who loses his head, who can't keep his cool, is worse than no ballplayer at all.;Lou Gehrig;cool
I know what it feels like to have the door slammed firmly in my face, so I'm cool with that.;Mos Def;cool
I am surprised by how not-adopted the video reply has been. What keeps other people from doing it, I think, is that they think a video comes across as 'I'm cool, look at how many e-mails I get.' That perception doesn't scare me, because I know who I am.;Gary Vaynerchuk;cool
People are more comfortable learning about wine because now they can just Google, you know, 'Soave,' and say, 'Oh, O.K., cool.';Gary Vaynerchuk;cool
In my teens, I was never part of the cool crowd.;Jennifer Garner;cool
For most of my life, I've thought of myself as pretty cool.;Nikki Giovanni;cool
When Brian told me he grew up in New Mexico, I told him I thought it is cool that people from other countries play football. He corrected me on my geography and agreed to sit down with me anyway.;Terry Bradshaw;cool
Personally, I was never the cool kid. I was always sort of a bookworm. I would just like to be more like Troy, because he's so cool.;Zac Efron;cool
Personally, I was never the cool kid. I was always sort of a bookworm.;Zac Efron;cool
Spider-Man's probably my favorite. You see, Batman is a billionaire and there's nothing really cool about a billionaire saving the world. But Spider-Man is Peter Parker, a conflicted character who puts on a suit and saves the world. I love that.;Zac Efron;cool
Yeah, I get to fight in 'Eclipse.' My trainer is teaching me MMA right now. So. Cool.;Ashley Greene;cool
My parents are pretty cool people.;Dominic Monaghan;cool
The term 'geek' for me is like you having a passion, interest in something that is unabashed and you don't care if people think it's not cool. You think it's cool and that's your thing.;Dominic Monaghan;cool
I am an unconventional beauty. I grew up in a high school where if you didn't have a nose job and money and if you weren't thin, you weren't cool, popular, beautiful. I was always told that I wasn't pretty enough to be on television.;Lea Michele;cool
But my main thing that I would love to see as a fan of 'Glee,' like I said, is to really get into the character and who they are and what they do outside of school. I think that that's interesting. And then of course the themed stuff and the album episodes are all really cool too.;Lea Michele;cool
I was in choir in school. I kind of just did it. I already knew I wanted to sing. My music program in my school wasn't really great - people didn't really want to be part of the choir, they didn't want to do the plays and stuff like that. It definitely wasn't the cool thing to do.;Lea Michele;cool
I really felt like I finally made it. Having your first fake pregnancy rumor. It was really awesome. I feel like it's part of what happens in this business, but that's a real one. That's a cool one to get.;Lea Michele;cool
I want to be a cool mom.;Tori Spelling;cool
I was never considered cool throughout my teens: a very important time to be accepted by someone, especially your peers. Yes, I had all the screaming women, but the guys hated my guts.;Donny Osmond;cool
Maybe I am a little bit guilty of trying to convince myself that I am cool to this point - even today. But I am so much more healthy than I used to be in my twenties, because I was not accepted at all.;Donny Osmond;cool
It's cool to play a vampire and be a part of this new, hot genre.;Josh Hutcherson;cool
When you get to play a character that's in love, it's cool.;Josh Hutcherson;cool
I've never believed in singing about Satan and thinking he's cool, because he's not.;Dave Mustaine;cool
Both conservatives and liberals watch 'Parks and Recreation,' and they each think the show is for them, which is really cool. 'SNL' was totally different. It was exciting because everyone was paying attention. Political humor works when people know what you're talking about.;Amy Poehler;cool
There's a lot of gimmick infringement out there, but that's cool. It's a compliment. But it all started right when I first came into the Garden. I came down to 'Eye of the Tiger' and when I hit the ring with the Sheik, I just put my hand up to my ear by accident, and the crowd got louder. I was like 'Oh, that works.';Hulk Hogan;cool
All of a sudden, Hulk Hogan has become retro. Hulk Hogan has become cool again. So to come out and to hear how loud the fans are. To hear how loyal the fans are, it's truly overwhelming. I just can't believe I've been reborn in the WWE.;Hulk Hogan;cool
My definition of cool is finding your own definition of cool and not necessarily taking your lead from what other people tell you or from what you might read from magazines or see on TV.;Wentworth Miller;cool
I got tired of the Ramones around the time I quit and I really got into rap. I thought it was the new punk rock. LL Cool J was my biggest idol.;Dee Dee Ramone;cool
Everything that's cool that happens, I look at my wife and I say, 'We need to enjoy this moment right here! This is really special!';Joe Nichols;cool
In my mind, as long as I did what was right for me, I was cool. But that's not the way it works. You have to think about other people and take their feelings into account.;Joe Nichols;cool

Americans are cool if you show just a chink of vulnerability, they respond so much. They'll pat you on the arm and say, 'Hey kid, you're all right.' Brits will respond but they are much more cynical.;Bear Grylls;cool
I'm blessed to have cool roles in these big movies.;Jeremy Renner;cool
I mean, there are some amazing storytelling being done on the small screen right now. That's what so cool about being in television right now. Studios, networks are starting to throw more resources, better writers, more production values... and to be part of that is awesome.;Ian Somerhalder;cool
I've helped create over 400 jobs in the worst economy of my lifetime. That's cool.;Curt Schilling;cool
My whole thing is that I want to explore why you read books, what's the purpose of reading, and maybe that it's not that cool to hate something just because it's popular.;Josh Radnor;cool
The thing that's cool about the recording booth is that it's so perfunctory, so cut-to-the-chase.;Ron Perlman;cool

Vince Vaughn is a genuine person, awesome guy. He'll come to a lot of my shows. It's not that often that you can meet someone as cool as Vince.;Dane Cook;cool
It's cool to express myself, but I've had to learn that doing interviews isn't completely therapy - spilling everything about yourself isn't healthy all the time. But I've been through things that have made me a stronger person, and if I can help some people, I will.;Fergie;cool
My parents were really, really cool about supporting what I wanted to do at a really young age. I think I was about 10 when I caught the bug.

More and more, Democrats are starting to worry they that they have a more um, colorful version of Jimmy Carter on their hands. Obama acts cool as a proverbial cucumber but that awful '70s show seems frightfully close to a rerun.;Eric Alterman;cool
I've noticed that once you leave London you do kind of become a bit more famous. People in London are a bit too cool for school. It's not so unusual to see someone from London in the street. But outside of London people are a bit more excited to see you and come out and support you.;David Walliams;cool
That was excellent! I mean, it didn't do anything, but it looked really cool!;Adam Savage;cool
I always hated high-school shows and high-school movies, because they were always about the cool kids. It was always about dating and sex, and all the popular kids, and the good-looking kids. And the nerds were super-nerdy cartoons, with tape on their glasses. I never saw 'my people' portrayed accurately.;Paul Feig;cool
It's healthy to have older friends. You go, 'Look, I'm younger than them!' That's always the nice thing, if you can be the youngest one in the room at times. Like if you're always the oldest one in the room, you'll start to feel like the oldest person in the world. So get older friends, because they're cool. Get cool older friends.;Paul Feig;cool
Period costume films are fun to discover, but they're not relatable. It's more, 'Wow, that's cool - did it really look like that back then?' Whereas with a comedy, you're like, 'Yeah, that's me, that's my friends.' No matter what, I want people to relate.;Paul Feig;cool
As tempting as it seems to wear tennis shoes with your tux, don't do it. I think it looks ridiculous. If you're 14 years old, maybe give it a shot. In general, don't portray anything that says 'I'm too cool and I don't care.';Paul Feig;cool
Most of an award-show host's job is showing up and keeping a cool head and soldiering through it, whether it's the Oscars or the Hallmark Channel's 'Hero Dog Awards.';Rob Sheffield;cool

I love Poseidon. His trident - his weapon - is really cool.;Kellan Lutz;cool
Hats off to starting a franchise younger than we all did in 'Twilight' and keeping your cool. The 'Harry Potter' men and women had, what, a 10-year run?;Kellan Lutz;cool
Even in high school, I had friends that I didn't know were gay until years later. I'd find out on Facebook or something and be like, 'Oh, that explains some things,' or 'Wow, no wonder they were so cool.';Kellan Lutz;cool
It's interesting because a lot of my 16-year-old kids' friends know me from 'Wedding Crashers,' and not so much Bond. My kids have a good laugh. I was 20 then. The look I had then was the look that a lot of their friends are assuming now. They think it's cool. What goes around comes around.;Jane Seymour;cool
I think you have to be cool to be a good flirt, and I don't think I'm very cool.;Harry Styles;cool
When I see my staff take a step back because I've lost my cool about something food-related, I say never apologise for your standards. If someone doesn't meet them, then you should explain that and that you want it changed. I want my staff to be like that, too.;Curtis Stone;cool
I got a chance to have my dream come true, and I wanted to make sure I made the decision as to when I dropped my last album. If I don't feel like this album is an incredible piece of work, then I'm cool with the albums I've done. I don't have to put out another album.;Puff Daddy;cool
Basically, after an ABC sitcom I did, I ended up with a holding deal with 20th Century Fox. Absolutely cool. It pays you to be unemployed. And the bigger the entity that gives you the deal, the better.;Nathan Fillion;cool
I'm constantly pitching one episode where we see life through Castle's eyes. I think Castle's just a little off as far as his perception goes. A very, very clever man, but I want to see the world as Castle sees it - kind of a rose-colored glasses, all the women find him irresistible, all the guys find him super cool and do whatever he says.;Nathan Fillion;cool
I'm comfortable only when there's a mutual attraction. That's what anyone wants. If I find out she's not attracted to me, it brings down my level of attraction to her. If I'm interested and find out she's not, I tend to cool off.;Nathan Fillion;cool
I think my printing to this day looks like the printing right out of a comic book. Actually, I always wanted to be in a comic book. I watched cartoons when I was a kid, too, and both comics and cartoons lit fire in my imagination. This realm holds a lot of interest for me, a lot of passion for me. So to be comic-ized, yeah, that's cool.;Nathan Fillion;cool
I remember my first test in F1. After five laps, I came back to the pits and tried to play it cool - 'Oh yeah, I'm fine, I'm on top of this' - but I was completely lost.;Sebastian Vettel;cool
That's the hardest thing about being a mom. You want to be cool, and you want them to like you all the time, but you can't always have that. You're gonna have times where you have to say no, and you won't be the most popular person in the house.;Martina McBride;cool
Traveling to Russia and Germany and being able to see the world at a young age was really cool for me, and I really liked that.;Mia Wasikowska;cool
Music is music, ultimately. If it makes you feel good, cool.;Prince;cool
Me and my dad are friends. We're cool. I'll never be disappointed again, because I don't expect anything anymore from him. I just let him exist, and that's how we get along.;Drake;cool
At the age of 11 I was about 6 ft. tall and my voice had completely broken. That caused problems. I was this gangly, spotty, very unattractive kid. I wasn't cool and I wasn't a nerd. I didn't even want to fit in with anyone.;Dan Stevens;cool
When I left Europe in 1987 I did so with the thought that my relevance as a composition teacher would benefit from a certain cool distance to certain tendencies I had been observing for several years with increasing disquiet.;Brian Ferneyhough;cool
I like cool jackets - a nice fall or winter coat. You can get a lot of use out of it, and you'll wear it frequently, so it can really set the tone of your uniform for the season.;John Legend;cool
Our career is a dream. I mean, we get to act, travel around the world, and meet cool people. What's not to love!;Mary-Kate Olsen;cool
Edie Sedgwick had a cool style she pushed the envelope for the time.;Taylor Momsen;cool
The thing people don't understand is that touring or travelling or whatever you do in my position means you go to all these cool places all over the world, but you see everything from a car window. You don't get to see much of the city or meet people at all.;Taylor Momsen;cool
My legs are really long and that's cool apparently, but I'm totally klutzy. I mean, I'm like Bambi. I fall all over myself because I can't control my arms and my really long legs.;Taylor Momsen;cool
Well, a sort of epiphany: I was in a great band. And it's very cool to be at 53 and realise that when you were a kid you were in a great band.;Bob Geldof;cool

We aren't cool and never will be.;Chris Martin;cool
My family moved - first to Washington, D.C., and then, in the spring of 1975, to Lebanon, where my father worked as a diplomat at the American embassy. My parents were enthusiastic about the move, so my older brother and I felt like we were off to some place kind of cool.;Greg Kinnear;cool

Jazz took too much discipline. You have to come in at the right place, which is different than me singing the blues, where I can sing, 'Oh, baby,' if there's a pause in the melody. With jazz, you better leave that space open, or put in something real cool.;Etta James;cool
It's always cool to meet people who can do things that you have no capacity to do.;Kevin James;cool

You make your first album, you make some money, and you feel like you still have to show face, like 'I still go to the projects.' I'm like, why? Your job is to inspire people from your neighborhood to get out. You grew up there. What makes you think it's so cool?;Jay-Z;cool
The cool part of being an entertainer is getting the opportunity to get your feet wet in all areas.;Paula Abdul;cool

All this stuff is so mind-blowing to me that I get to do in my life. Throwing the first pitch out at the White Sox game on a random Wednesday? Like who am I? How did I get this life? I'm glad I'm not jaded, and little kids are the least jaded people in the entire world, so it's fun to be around people that still find wonder in how cool things are.;Jonah Hill;cool
'Allen Gregory' came about because we wanted an animated show and we were just tossing around some ideas about me playing a 7-year-old. We thought that would be cool, because we couldn't do that in real life.;Jonah Hill;cool

51st State was one that I loved doing because the character was so out there, and in a way I was sad to leave the character behind. I'm afraid I could never be that cool in real life!;Emily Mortimer;cool

I was in a really crummy pop-punk band. I think we did a whole bunch of Blink-182 covers, and we were on the fringe of losers and jocks.

I think it's really cool, but Jimmy Eat World and Gin Blossoms did it better than anyone. People don't realize just how awesome the Arizona history is, especially for alternative music. Growing up, that's all I ever wanted to be was those two bands.;Nate Ruess;cool
I'm a fan of designers and clothes that look beautiful, but more importantly, make me feel beautiful and confident. It's why I've always loved Stella McCartney, and more recently, Prabal Gurung. Their pieces are cool, yet timeless, and the fits are effortlessly flattering.;Shay Mitchell;cool

Most of the time you're too busy to think about it. But every now and then you say, 'I work at 'Saturday Night Live,' and that is so cool.;Tina Fey;cool
I wanted to escape Small Town U.S.A. To dismiss the boundaries, to explore. My life experience came from watching movies, TV, and reading books and magazines.

As an investor, what we're not looking for is 'oh this is a cool app,' it's 'is this something that can become a big business?' You need to find those that can become real businesses.;Niklas Zennstrom;cool

I thought Daredevil was kind of cool because he couldn't do anything. I mean, he's blind. It wasn't that he could fly. His major power was an impediment. So I was intrigued. When I took over he was kind of like Spider-Man-lite, but I was able to project a lot of my Catholic imagery onto it. And I'd always wanted to do a crime comic.;Frank Miller;cool
But acting is very much a profession that is you're hot one moment and not the next - and that is totally cool. I think that's what I find most fascinating and most exciting about it - is that it can be gone in a puff of smoke.;Keira Knightley;cool

When the soul drifts uncertainly between life and the dream, between the mind's disorder and the return to cool reflection, it is in religious thought that we should seek consolation.;Gerard De Nerval;cool

When I was 24, I was full of life. I was that ham who wanted to be famous, a movie star, all that stuff. I think it's cool. But it was not what I was searching for, really. It was more a delusion.;Jean Claude Van Damme;cool
We have newsreaders behaving like actors, lowering their voices if it's a sad story, as if we didn't know it's a sad story. There isn't a single cool newsreader.;Tom Baker;cool
Sydney in the 1960s wasn't the exuberant multicultural metropolis it is today. Out in the city's western reaches, days passed in a sun-struck stupor.

I've had fans come and knock on my door. I'm usually polite, but I'm usually very direct and say, 'It's not cool that you come here uninvited.';Gary Allan;cool
I was a 'Duck Hunt' and 'Mario' guy, and stuff like that. I was never technologically driven. I never had all the cool, new toys.

I just check my email.;Garrett Hedlund;cool
What's weird is that I work with these directors and then I start channeling them. I kind of turn into them a bit - which is cool when you're working with Clint Eastwood.;Jamie Bell;cool

We do this basically for ourselves. People appreciate it, which is cool, but I think they appreciate that we're doing it for ourselves. We're doing it our way, and how people like it is not up to us. We like it.;James Hetfield;cool
In Hollywood today, it's cool for guys to wear nail polish and earrings in their lips and tongues. I don't get it.;Scott Caan;cool

I wasn't one of the cool kids by any stretch. I just bumbled along really.;Matthew Rhys;cool
Well, it's a little harder in New York. It's not as forgiving to a film crew. You hold up a bunch of New Yorkers who can't cross the street, they're not going to take it well. Southern California? They'll wait. It's cool man. In New York, they're like, 'Are you kidding me? I gotta get to work.';Matthew Rhys;cool
When I was younger, the pressure was just being cool. I never thought of myself as a cool guy. I always thought of myself as more of the goofy guy.;Paul Walker;cool
I could finally quit my job as a bartender and stop dreaming that I might be Superman and know that I was. Then I started thinking about how cool it was.;Brandon Routh;cool

There aren't as many girl superheroes, but there are cool ones. Banshee, for instance.;Kat Dennings;cool
I'd love to be an artist that's multifaceted. At the moment, I am not. But wouldn't that be cool if I was like, 'Yeah, let me pull out my guitar and play you a song.' I would adore that.

I'm thought of as a cool, unemotional dancer, but inside I'm not.;Suzanne Farrell;cool
My sister has three kids so I've spent a lot of time around children and I've always really liked them and wanted my own. It's cool because you think all babies are the same but they aren't at all. They all have such different personalities. It's crazy.;Bode Miller;cool

For a long time the people at my shows were sort of the Pantera-tattoo trucker guys, really cool dudes, but I don't know what happened to them. That's the crowd that I like, the ones that don't get so offended just to be offended.;Dave Attell;cool
I don't watch reality TV. I'm cool.;Dave Attell;cool
The band feels loose in all the right ways, and it's just so cool looking out and seeing all of these people that I haven't seen in a while.;Trey Anastasio;cool
You know, you grow up with the image of John Travolta being super cool - 'Saturday Night Fever,' Brian De Palma, handsome young god... he, in reality, is a very silly man. And I mean that in a good way. He'll walk around the set talking in little weird voices, making people laugh.;Eric Stoltz;cool
What's cool about indie rock is that one band can do effectively the same thing as another band, and one band nails it, and the other one doesn't. I like that elusiveness.;Andrew Bird;cool

I could never dream of being cool.;Andrea Corr;cool

My relationship with my mom is so amazing. We never got to have that stage that people go through, like when you're 13 and you think you're too cool for your parents.

You show up in Paris, and on the drive from the airport to the hotel you're like, 'This is so cool! I want to see something! I want to go to the Eiffel Tower!' And then you leave the next morning.

To me, what I love about the draft is first, you see the young men who are realizing their dreams that they've worked so hard for. That's a pretty cool thing. You saw the emotion from some of these guys the other day. And then, the second thing is this total sense of hope and optimism. And, I think that's great for everybody.;Roger Goodell;cool
I do, I kick major butt in 'Dredd.' I get to kill people. I break a guy's neck by roundhouse kicking him in the face. It was me, I did it. I learned how to roundhouse kick.

The cool thing about music is no one can take music away from you, writing wise.;Darren Criss;cool

If you can get a teen leader in each sector of a student population, you can pull people in. Everybody wants to get involved, but most are too afraid. When they see a person they think is cool leading it, they're first to join.;Andrew Shue;cool
I'm way better in person than I am on things like Twitter. I know Twitter is the best and fastest way to connect with fans who really appreciate you but I'm still not cool with it - although I am trying! I try my best but I'm a one-on-one person and I don't want to tell people I'm on the toilet or I just brushed my teeth.;Nicole Scherzinger;cool

Being in America isn't old-hat - it's where we're from - but I get excited to be in other parts of the world like Athens and Croatia, which were quite cool. I'm a sightseer. I go see the sights and museums. I'm into that kind of thing.;Richie Sambora;cool
My mother used to take me to flea markets in my stroller, and I would just rummage through the piles. You've got to dig through the overstuffed racks that everyone else just walks by. It's the only way to find the cool stuff.;Lily Collins;cool

Belly buttons are cool!;Lauren Graham;cool
In my books the technology that I choose to talk about has to serve the themes.

I may be the prat in the hat, that's cool, but I drive an Aston Martin DB5.;Jay Kay;cool
With 'The Host,' I think the actors could be really big names. That would be cool. I'd love to see Robert Redford put on a beard and be Jeb he would be amazing...

When certain bootleg companies started off and they would take maybe ten per cent of whatever they got and help fuel new bands, which I'm cool with, I think that's a good idea. Most of the record companies are not doing that.;David Coverdale;cool
Adele's amazing, I think the world of her and her music and I think Tinie Tempah is cool. To work with someone like Kanye West would be awesome.;Joe Jonas;cool
It's just cool for a girl to be able to do her own thing. I do a lot of movies, and I'm very lucky, and I'm not complaining. But in movies, alongside big action men, we've always got to take a step back and let the men shine.;Maggie Q;cool
He's as cool as a prized marrow!;Sid Waddell;cool
But this is Miami, you can't come to Miami and not show any skin. You gotta show something. If you're all covered up in this heat, you're gonna make me pass out out just to look at you. It's sweaty in Miami-but the diamonds will keep me cool.;Lil' Kim;cool
The private interest of the individual would not be sufficiently provided for by reasonable and cool self-love alone therefore the appetites and passions are placed within as a guard and further security, without which it would not be taken due care of.;Joseph Butler;cool

I never saw music in terms of men and women or black and white. There was just cool and uncool.;Bonnie Raitt;cool
New York had a big influence on me growing up, and I was really part of the club scene - the Mudd Club and Studio 54. When you're living in New York, you are just bombarded with style, trying to figure out how to be cool and how to feel relaxed at the same time.;Dylan McDermott;cool
My dad was kind of a pool shark and had a Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin thing going on. I've always been fascinated by the fifties because of him. There was a hip, cool, anything-goes atmosphere back then, but looking good was still a priority.;Dylan McDermott;cool

Honestly, I'm cool with everyone, and people pick up on that. I'd say, 'I'm not gay, but it's all good.' It's kind of like going to Paris when you don't know the language some Americans get into trouble over there, but I'm just like, 'Sorry, I don't speak French.';Dylan McDermott;cool
Sometimes guys are so concerned with being cool and hanging out with their friends. They don't want to seem like the guy that 'has to call his girlfriend.' It's just boys growing up.;Kristin Cavallari;cool

My music was never considered cool, but I've always felt that connection with the audience.;David Cassidy;cool
I would never do a commercial for something that is embarrassing, and I think that people maybe have a different perspective on what is embarrassing or not.

It's pretty cool that people will pay for something even though they don't have to. It's totally different now to back in the day. Now you're paying for a record because you believe in the band. In the future that will be the only time people will pay for albums, because there's some kind of connection.;Ezra Koenig;cool
I didn't want to come up with some generic Johnny Bravo type name. I'm not that cool, so I might as well stick with my birth name.;Colin Hanks;cool

The truth is, we have this idea that late night is about creativity and being cool, but that's not our job. Our job is to get as many people watching the commercials in between our show. That's the reality of it.;Jimmy Kimmel;cool

David Lynch and I almost made a movie together in the late '80s. We had lots of dinners and lunches. He's a very cool, hip guy. This film, let's face it, is like an homage to him, I would imagine he'd find it funny.;Martin Short;cool
I like rhythmic things that butt up against each other in a cool kind of way.;Stone Gossard;cool

Actually just recently I came up with that idea, watching the movie 'Legally Blonde' and I was like, 'Cool, that's something I want to do.';Lisa Leslie;cool

I never set out to become 'famous.' I mean, when you're 14 you think 'I'm gonna become a writer and people will want my autograph and that'll be cool,' but you grow up and you learn that's just not how the world works. I resigned myself to the fact that I would probably never be published and if I did it probably wouldn't be a big deal.;Patrick Rothfuss;cool

Roy Schneider was cool. I learned quite a bit from him.;Jonathan Brandis;cool

Everyone in Hollywood wanted a role in this movie. Everyone wanted to have a part in it. I feel so lucky that I got one, but what I find so cool about 'Hunger Games' is that the real star is the story itself.;Alexander Ludwig;cool
When I first started acting I was about nine years old. I had never been to audition in my life and my agent sent me out. It was just a commercial for 'Harry Potter.'

In politics almost all of us are nerds, so that's just a given... but we're cool nerds.;Jonathan Krohn;cool

If I took over the 'Glamour' offices for a day, I would put Joe Pesci on the cover. I would say 'We've got to change all these magazines a little bit. We have to bring out a different version of what is, like, cool. You know, what's winning. Joe Pesci, Burt Reynolds.';Jake Johnson;cool
You know, what 'New Girl' is doing is they're bringing in really cool people. These are home-run people who aren't your typical guest-star-type people.;Jake Johnson;cool
My first three years of high school, I wasn't that cool.;Jonathan Bennett;cool
I never think of myself as any kind of sex symbol, but I get letters from all over, all sorts. It's really cool. I get a lot from inmates, which is kind of scary. But the best was the guy who wanted to send me a plane ticket to fly me to his prom.;Laura Prepon;cool
There are some people who have stayed with us our whole career, which is pretty cool too.;Mike McCready;cool

Having your own character in a video game is pretty cool.;Josie Maran;cool

Unless something real cool comes along, I will probably be doing features, so long as I can make a living doing that. Otherwise, I will do another show.;Danny Masterson;cool
I am a huge fashion fan. It's a really cool way to express yourself.;Kiernan Shipka;cool
I do resent that when you're in the most cool, powerful time of your life, which is your 40s, you're put out to pasture. I think women are so much cooler when they're older. So it's a drag that we're not allowed to age.;Rosanna Arquette;cool
If it was just me and Elvis one on one, which only happened once or twice in the times that I did see him, it was a really comfortable. He was a cool guy. Easy laugh, nice guy.;Mac Davis;cool
I think you go through a period as a teenager of being quite cool and unaffected by things.;Miranda Otto;cool
I definitely dislike pomposity and artifice. I hope that I'm not that. Once I write a song, it belongs to the world, and the way people perceive it, it's cool.;Daryl Hall;cool
The simplest way to do something cool is the cross-turn. Like in the '80s - Michael Jackson did it. You jump and cross your legs together at the same time, and then spin out of it. That's it.;Heather Morris;cool
You don't want to be too cool. But you don't want to be too dorky. Still, I find it so much better to see a guy at a club being a dork, and having fun, than trying to be sexy.;Heather Morris;cool
I just did a part in 'Sin City 2.' I got to do a scene with Ray Liotta. Amazing man, extraordinary gentleman who was just so kind to me... I'm so excited about that I think it's gonna be very cool.;Juno Temple;cool
Almost all the fans I meet are pretty cool people. They're intelligent and tend to think about things a bit more than your average rock'n'roll fans: sensible people I wouldn't mind having a drink with.;Peter Buck;cool
The name Crow was inspired by a number of things. I thought it would be cool to have a robot with sort of a Native American feel to it.;Joel Hodgson;cool

It feels quite cool, in a mad way, to be someone who skulks about in the shadows.;Peter Baynham;cool
I'd wear flip-flops and jeans. I guess that's not cool.;Bill Rancic;cool

Everyone focuses on the earthly state, but how cool might death be? I believe in spiritual rebirth, and I can't wait to experience that.;Barry Zito;cool

I think I'm much too earnest to be as cool as 'Boyd Crowder'.;Walton Goggins;cool
I love Prince Harry. Good looking and a bit of a rebel. Me and his dad are as thick as thieves and I knew Harry before I knew his dad so we've met a few times. I think he's amazing. And I think you can relate to him because he's made mistakes. He's cool.;Cheryl Cole;cool
My friend and I sang an a cappella rendition of Extreme's 'More Than Words' at one of our football pep rallies in a desperate attempt to look cool. For a while, I wore pink Converse All Stars because I thought it made me seem daring and irreverent.;Ed Helms;cool
I try to explain to people that you get the roles that are right when they're right. If you have a nerd character but you're kind of a cool guy, you're probably not going to get the nerd part. The nerd is going to get the nerd part. You know, someone like me.;Ed Helms;cool
I'm a massive fan of Drake, and we walked right past him. He's too cool to be clapping One Direction though.;Zayn Malik;cool

I think that was a moment of cool panic there.;Ron Atkinson;cool
I love seeing people having fun. Everyone over in L.A. is too cool for it. That's the problem.;Lukas Haas;cool

I'm not geeky but I have my geeky, corky moments, and then I've got some aspects of cool in me, I guess.;Nick Cannon;cool

I always loved Kate Winslet, but after you meet her you really love her because she's a cool chick.;Peter Farrelly;cool
When you have kids, you just love them. It's similar to when you're in love with someone.

I want her to actually want to see me, so that's what I'm going for!;Jeremy Sisto;cool
I just got an iPhone, which is cool, but I don't download movies, I don't watch Hulu, I don't have Netflix. I don't do any of that. But I do geek out to music.;Miles Teller;cool
When things are really good, really easy it's not cool for me.;Romario;cool

I know a lot of people dread going to work every morning, but my work is playing pretend and doing stunts and screaming. It's a lot of fun and I get to play dress up. Every day is exciting and different and new and cool. I couldn't be more grateful.;Nina Dobrev;cool

I actually bought a travel guitar, and that guitar is really cool. You can actually fold the guitar, and you can plug headphones into it, but it's acoustic, or semi-acoustic.;Daniel Ek;cool
I'm not going chic, I swear. The geek endures. But, I mean, a snazzy cool suit looks good.;Jon Heder;cool
I'm not that into reading. If I'm gonna read, I'm gonna read some cool sci-fi book or something, not some stupid self-help book.;Jon Heder;cool
I think working with Johnny Depp was very intimidating. It was my fault though. I mean he's a total cool nice, nice guy, but I was just so, I don't know, overpowered by his presence. Like he's a very mystic person. He's older so I never really warmed up around him. I was so stiff.;Franka Potente;cool
I would think flying would be pretty cool. You would be able to fly away from all your enemies and get where you're going much faster. But being invisible? You probably wouldn't use that for the good of man.;Randy Johnson;cool
We should be recklessly abandoned to Jesus, and just turn it over to Him. Through the support I think the sacrifices will be made and we'll all be cool with it.;Stacie Orrico;cool

I didn't audition for the part! The role was offered to me, and I was so excited to be a part of 'The Haunting Hour.' It is such a cool show and it was so much fun shooting the 'Intruders.';Willow Shields;cool
For 'The Haunting Hour,' I thought it would be a lot of fun. It was great to play this cool kid role. My episode is called 'The Intruders' and my character is this mean, angry teenager because her younger brother was just born and he gets all of the attention. She's always playing tricks on her family, and there are some cool twists.;Willow Shields;cool
Even though I never worked with her, it was still really cool to have Brooke Shields on set. She was so nice and so funny.;Atticus Shaffer;cool

I like men who are very cool but who are also so brilliant that they are almost insane. Sean Penn, Gary Oldman, Bob Dylan, Tom Waits - men who would be flipping burgers if they hadn't found an outlet for their brilliant mind-sets.;Jolene Blalock;cool
My favorite type of music to sing and to listen to, you know, rock. It's not always metal, but you know, half the time it is. Metal's cool, you know? Not everybody on 'American Idol' listens to metal.;James Durbin;cool
I like America. I think it's pretty cool.;Mary Lynn Rajskub;cool
I was a drama major also so it's cool to cuss for meaning, but for no apparent reason, no.;Kel Mitchell;cool

People always used to say to me, 'Don't you want your own show? That'd be so cool if you had your own show.' I said, 'You know, it's not gonna happen. So - no.';Candy Crowley;cool
All literature consists of whatever the writer thinks is cool. The reader will like the book to the degree that he agrees with the writer about what's cool.;Steven Brust;cool

A female piano player is always pretty cool to me.;Chrisette Michele;cool
So, it's cool that, yes, Hal Jordan is a superhero, but my character is a real-world hero in her own life.;Blake Lively;cool
I just really like fun, cool, interesting, quirky girls. And sometimes you find that in 6'2 model bodies and sometimes they're short and brunette. All shapes and sizes - it's really about the personality. That sounds cliche, but it's so freaking true!;Dylan O'Brien;cool
What we do every night is we change out the set list as much as we can to make sure that (fans can) go home and tell their friends they experienced something unique and cool.;Isaac Hanson;cool
One of the great bands we opened up for was Priest back in '89. That was really great because at that time we had never met them, never toured with them before. They were a big influence on Slayer, so to open up for them was really cool.;Dave Lombardo;cool
To me, it all comes down to things being character-driven. It's hard for me to look beyond that. CG and all this cool stuff - so be it. But to me, it pretty much begins and ends with character-driven plots rather than technologically-driven plots.;Billy West;cool
The nude scenes were a little eerie and I felt a bit odd. Yeah, when the camera scanned up my body, I said to my friend, 'Now, that's a close-up.' I mean, you see every inch of my body. But I'm okay with it and so it was cool.;Natasha Henstridge;cool
Almost any film that you do is an opportunity to open you up and make you more aware of an area that you might not be thinking about. That's what is kind of cool, or one of the cool things about this profession.;Joan Allen;cool
Rhyme patterns are nothing without meanings to the words. A lot of rappers can do those flows, but the raps aren't really about anything - which is cool sometimes, but to have the flow and the message is one of my favorite things.;J. Cole;cool
When you go in and do a cool, small character, it feels less like work and more like fun.;Balthazar Getty;cool
I remember being in Atlantic City once when I was 18 or 19, and a sea of people were screaming and pulling their hair because I was there. It was weird. Nobody deserves adulation like that. I tried to explain it to my kids once. I said, 'Mommy used to be kind of cool, kind of like a Britney Spears.';Genie Francis;cool
It was really cool to work with Dakota Fanning. I've watched her grow up and I've always loved her films, loved her.

We got on really well she's so professional and hardworking.;Kaya Scodelario;cool
My niece was very much caught up in the vampire craze for young adults, and she thought having a vampire boyfriend would be a cool thing. What do you do on a first date? The more I thought about it, the more fun I had imagining what you'd serve a vampire for dinner.;Deborah Harkness;cool

It's just cool to me that Bon Jovi knows my name!;Josh Hopkins;cool
Being an author of banned books is cool, I've decided.;Lauren Myracle;cool

That's always a cool thing to be the voice of what the eyes are seeing. It gives you the role of the Greek chorus and that's always fun to do.;Jorge Garcia;cool
I just saw the movie for the first time in its entirely last night. It's really cool when you're in with an audience that's so tuned in and plugged in to what's going on.;Sasha Alexander;cool
Sometimes, the other characters are too normal and then you start to be brought back to reality but then Luna shows up and she is just so funny and cool and honest and slightly mad and she's all that matters. She is 100% true. She puts on no shows, because she is so comfortable with herself.;Evanna Lynch;cool
As a father, you immediately become uncool, especially the older they get. The older you get, it's inevitable that, as cool as you think you are, you're probably just as lame in your kids' eyes.;Mark Consuelos;cool
You always have in the back of your mind that would be cool if you get recognized. But you can't concentrate on any of those things. You've got to just keep playing and doing your music and the rest is just a bonus.;Michael Kiwanuka;cool
My role in 'Legally Blonde' was really rewarding, because I had so much fun working on the movie. I've had really rewarding experiences on tiny low budget films that you'll never see but where I had a cool time creating characters as well. I love almost all of the characters I've played.;Alanna Ubach;cool
That wasn't the way that things was supposed to be. And all because the so-called culture that I thought was right, that I thought it was cool, and I thought it was fun, and it was exciting at the time. It all led to me laying in a prison bunk by myself with no one to talk to but myself.;Michael Vick;cool
I try not to name too many labels - not because it's not cool, but because it starts getting political.;Nelly;cool
I'm confident - confident in my skin, and I'm cool with my flaws and all that stuff.;Minka Kelly;cool
Now that I finally have the time for it, this web surfing stuff turns out to be as interesting and fun and addictive as you've all been telling me. Zipping from link to link, chasing an idea across the noosphere, sucking up information like a killer whale - way cool.;Spider Robinson;cool
I hate it when people come up to me on trains and ask 'Are you Soulja Boy?' If people want pictures or autographs, that's cool, but I don't like the dumb questions.;Soulja Boy;cool
I love my mother Ali so much. I'm a momma's boy. I just have a very cool mom. It's not as though I had any say in the matter. I'm just really fortunate. She's the most kind, loving, giving woman.;Hayden Christensen;cool
Greg Berlanti, David Nutter, Andrew Kreisberg and Marc Guggenheim are the people I wanted to work with. They're smart, they're funny, they're cool, they're edgy.;Katie Cassidy;cool
I wouldn't compare myself to any past Idol contestant, because I don't feel like I am like any of them. Maybe stories are cool but my story is different from most people's story. I don't like to compare myself to other people, I like to just be me.;Naima Adedapo;cool
The Dead was cool, It's a great horror story. I went to the casting director of this movie and talked to him, then they called my agent and had me come in and read for it and they wanted to use me.;Matthew McGrory;cool
Cool things happen. Ace's guitar flies through space, goes through a hole, and blows up. I throw drumsticks and they come flying at you.;Peter Criss;cool
I have this idealistic and maybe naive thought that almost any song can be anything. If you record one song today, it would maybe be exciting and cool. But I could record the same song next week and it would be something completely different.;Sondre Lerche;cool
I work with really cool people, and so far I haven't been approached in any embarrassing manner when it comes to image.;Sondre Lerche;cool
There is a bit of a movement as far as younger people in country music. That is cool because people are saying things like, 'I didn't listen to country music until so-and-so came along.' And I'm like, 'Yeah! Now you know why I love it.';Hunter Hayes;cool
You're not really necessarily the coolest guy in their life. You are a conduit to the really cool people.;Tony Shalhoub;cool
We found out the Gemini spacesuit was, well, oxygen was flowing to keep me cool as well as to breathe, and it wasn't good enough. My visor got fogged.;Gene Cernan;cool
A guy's biggest style mistake is definitely trying to look too cool. As long as you've got a good pair of jeans, a good pair of boots and a few good shirts, you're fine.;Luke Evans;cool
I liked the name Frog Brigade because it lent itself to a lot of cool imagery with the whole frog thing.;Les Claypool;cool
I have this desire to just while away weeks, months and years. It took me two years to make this record but that was with me trying to condense my process and not disappear down the rabbit hole with all the cool things I've collected. I could take 10 years and not explore everything I want to with these instruments.;Gotye;cool
Maybe you are the 'cool' generation If coolness means a capacity to stay calm and use your head in the service of ends passionately believed in, then it has my admiration.;Kingman Brewster, Jr.;cool
Spiderman can climb walls and he's got a cool outfit.;Rhona Mitra;cool
I am kind of a private person, so I don't miss that part of show business at all.

I was involved in shows that people grew up with - that hold memories for them - and it's a cool feeling.;Angela Cartwright;cool
I love crispy, cool sheets.;Ryan Murphy;cool
There is something exciting about being in an environment in which it's really cool to be smart.;Freeman A. Hrabowski III;cool
Looking so cool, his greed is hard to conceal, he's fresh out of law school, you gave him a license to steal.;Al Stewart;cool
I'm a big fan of all the Boston guys that are acting - Matt Damon , Ben Affleck, Mark Wahlberg - they made a great career out of it, and they found a way to do it and still be cool guys, so that's kind of where I want to be.;Kenny Wormald;cool
I was a dancer, and it's not really cool for a boy to dance, so it was inspiring to see a movie like 'Footloose' where a guy is dancing masculine and had a proper reason behind it. It made me feel cool, and when these kids would make fun of me, I'd be like, 'Oh, didn't you see 'Footloose,' man?';Kenny Wormald;cool
I think it can be fun to be single and date-like when you don't want a relationship. Or when you've just gotten out of a relationship, and, after get over the initial shock, your thinking, Hey, it's kind of cool being single.;Breckin Meyer;cool
My whole family actually, but my parents. I had such a normal and amazing childhood. I've been so lucky. My parents are cool and normal. They don't talk about the business and I still have stuff to do at their house.;Kaley Cuoco;cool
I used to skip out of high school and go flying. It was just one of those things, I thought it was kind of a cool thing to do. I never thought about doing that as a profession, but I started checking things out and I found out there was a flight school down in Daytona Beach, called Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.;Jerry Doyle;cool
I was 35 years old and in a position to take a shot at whatever I wanted to try. The Air Force said I was too old to fly fighter jets. I thought about becoming a fishing boat captain, before deciding that acting seemed pretty cool.;Jerry Doyle;cool
I got a phone call from Fearne Cotton. It was amazing! I literally couldn't believe it. It was so cool. It was the night before I was going on her show to sing on the 'Live Lounge.' She was so lovely.;Birdy;cool
Dinosaurs was a cool idea, but we just couldn't find a way to make it really fun. We've got a bunch of great game ideas that we want to bring to life over the next several years.;Sid Meier;cool
I went to engineering school, which I thought was what I wanted to do, for about two weeks. We had an orientation class and we met this guy where he worked and stuff and it was cool, but I was like, 'There is no way this is going to be my life.';Evan Glodell;cool
With these men and women who work-for the cause with all their hearts, with cool heads and skilled hands we will master every fate.;Gustav Krupp;cool
Atlanta is an incredibly cool city.;Andrew Lincoln;cool
I liked the way my character, Shane, was first introduced. You get introduced to her through this sexual action, and I thought that was so cool and just kind of summed up what she enjoys and who she is, to a certain extent. She's a complete sexual being and the great thing is that she doesn't apologize for it. It's just who she is. We rarely see women be able to do that on television.;Katherine Moennig;cool
What I like about the 'Underworld' thing is that it's a mix of cool genres, as well as creating its own message.;Theo James;cool
I saw 'Captain America' in 3D. It's cool. I liked the beginning. It's a really good setup.;Theo James;cool
I've got two brothers and two sisters, so there's five of us and we're all very close, which is cool.;Theo James;cool
I like starting. It's pretty cool.;Al Leiter;cool
I'm a big techno fan. I love that thumping kick drum. We heard a version of 'Lost in Love' and it was thrash metal. It sounded cool!;Graham Russell;cool
I know some actors feel classes are not cool or they create negative public relations, but I continue to crave the story just beyond my reach. To grasp that brass ring I need to continue to fine-tune my talents.;Michael Welch;cool
And when I was a kid being an actor was not cool. I'm thirty now and when I was a kid in the 80s that wasn't a cool thing to be.;Vincent Kartheiser;cool
Again, like I said, we're not trying to censor anyone. If you think drugs are cool, fine. Make that movie. We are not going to stop you, or try to stop you, but we would encourage other people to be a bit more responsible about their portrayal of drug usage.;Gerald McRaney;cool
I do love to walk around in New York because people will notice me, smile, but they never bother anyone. New Yorkers are very cool. I love New York.;Creed Bratton;cool
I grew up on the South Side of Chicago, north Beverly. It was cool, everybody's cool on the block.;Craig Robinson;cool
Working with Omarion is pretty amazing. That's like my brother. He's really cool.;Teyana Taylor;cool
When I was in high school, my friends and I would drive out into the country to abandoned houses and structures... haha... to ghost hunt. We would scare each other so bad! We would sometimes camp out by the abandoned buildings just to scare ourselves! Such good times. The adrenaline of real fear is so cool!;Keegan Allen;cool
I don't want to stay underground for just the cool people.;Buzz Osborne;cool
Being a kid and growing up is such a cool part of life.;Devon Werkheiser;cool
The alternative scene, for a couple years now, has been taken seriously and that's a cool thing. I don't think it's exploded or anything, but I think it's pretty cool that it still exists, it's still affecting people.;Bob Odenkirk;cool
I noticed that this defense attorney is a very, very intelligent man, and he's very cool and he's very knowledgeable, and I think that personally I'd like to have an attorney like him.;Tommy Bond;cool
Everyone is different, but I'm not standoffish at all. I'm not one of those people who prefer to write a note. I'll walk right up to you and ask you out! Even if the answer's no, I'm totally cool with it.;Corbin Bleu;cool
I am a very open, social, friendly person, and when it comes to people approaching me and asking for an autograph, I am totally cool with doing any of that. It's a lot of fun.;Corbin Bleu;cool
A couple days ago, I saw a lot of people tweeting, 'Oh, it's so cool 'Home' is being used in the Olympics!' We don't really get to watch much TV, man, with the concerts every night, but I wish I could have seen it. I really just found out through Twitter and my management texting me. I thought it was really awesome.;Phillip Phillips;cool
I think there are four or five interesting pockets where a lot of cool technology companies are getting started. Chicago is one of them. New York is certainly another. Silicon Valley really dominates. And you're seeing some stuff out of Boston and Seattle and down South.;Eric Lefkofsky;cool
And getting stunt coordinator Dan Bradley and everybody from the whole 'Bourne Supremacy' crew, I think was real cool for our film because we do a bunch of really big jumps in this movie.;Sean William Scott;cool
I just thought it could make a really cool movie. It's not that it's just a buddy comedy but it's all about two guys hating each other and towards the end they're good friends. I liked that these two guys were best friends from the very beginning, and they're crazy.;Sean William Scott;cool
I think it's really cool to embrace the pain of something that may have hurt you and be able to express it through music.;Ciara;cool
People spend hours constantly checking and tweeting and Facebooking. And it's cool to check up on your friends and see what's going on in the world, but it's not cool to spend five hours of your day on the computer looking at the Internet.;Ty Segall;cool
Well, I look at it like this: When you go to a restaurant, the less you know about what happens in the kitchen, the more you enjoy your meal. If the soup tastes good, everything's cool, and you don't necessarily want to know what's in it. The same thing holds true with movies.;Jeffrey Wright;cool
It's really cool to know that you've put something together that isn't for a particular audience. It's so often that a TV show can really only speak to one sect of the population, and this really is something that appeals to a worldwide fan base. People who are into the pursuit of knowledge. Their reaction has meant the world to us.;David Krumholtz;cool

I'd love to pop back into 'Being Human' as Adam. I love the character so much. I've never really played a character like that. I'm always playing the geek, so to play a kid who is very energetic when he wants to be, and who is always trying to get the girls, was really cool.;Craig Roberts;cool

Looking back, I think I was always musical. My dad was very musical, and I think my mom was musical.;Paul McCartney;dad

For me, growing up, the downside of it was that as a kid you don't want to stand out. You don't want to have a famous father let alone get a job because of your famous father, you know? But I'm a product of nepotism. That's how I got my foot in the door, through my dad.;Jeff Bridges;dad

One afternoon when I was 9, my dad told me I'd be skipping school the next day. Then we drove 12 hours from Melbourne to Sydney for the Centenary Test, a once-in-a-lifetime commemorative cricket match. It was great fun - especially for a kid who was a massive sports fan.;Hugh Jackman;dad

My parents always provided that.;Marco Rubio;dad
My dad was a bartender. My mom was a cashier, a maid and a stock clerk at K-Mart. They never made it big. They were never rich. And yet they were successful.

My dad used to say, 'Just because you dress up in a coat and tie, it doesn't influence your intelligence.';Tiger Woods;dad

My dad's a beautiful man, but like a lot of Mexican men, or men in general, a lot of men have a problem with the balance of masculinity and femininity - intuition and compassion and tenderness - and get overboard with the macho thing.

Most children - I know I did when I was a kid - fantasize another set of parents. Or fantasize no parents. They don't tell their real parents about that - you don't want to tell Mom and Dad. Kids lead a very private life. And I was a typical child, I think. I was a liar.;Maurice Sendak;dad

'Nil By Mouth' was a bit autobiographical, but as I always pointed out at the time, that's not my dad.;Gary Oldman;dad

I'll back up anything my dad says.;Floyd Mayweather, Jr.;dad
To be fair to my dad, he is one of the brightest men I've ever met.;Philip Seymour Hoffman;dad

Becoming a dad was the proudest moment of my life. Playing football does not even compare.;Wayne Rooney;dad

Barack Obama knows that to create an economy built to last, we need to focus on middle-class families.

Families who aren't sure what Monday morning will bring, but who believe our nation's best days are still ahead.;Charles Schumer;dad
I would have to say the person with whom I am most in love is definitely my son, Everly Bear. Although I'm his dad, I'm also his friend.;Anthony Kiedis;dad
My dad was in the army. World War II. He got his college education from the army. After World War II he became an insurance salesman. Really, I didn't know my dad very well.

My mom and dad met at Anaheim High School. After they got married, all they wanted to do was have four children, and they did.;Gwen Stefani;dad

My dad was a Communist Party member who fought for his country.;Tim Roth;dad

The golden child may be the oldest one, unless it's the youngest. It may be the toughest one, unless it's the most sensitive. It's not even necessary that Mom and Dad have the same favorite - and typically they don't.;Jeffrey Kluger;dad
My dad spent his whole life getting into fights for telling what he believed to be the truth. Basically it comes from my dad-and he's screaming right-wing, so there you are.;Thom Yorke;dad
When my dad divorced my mom it was kind of like him leaving me also.;Nicole Richie;dad

I think the hardest thing about making music now is being a great dad at the same time. There's an insanity that goes with writing - a mad scientist thing that you have to go through - and sacrificing a kid's upbringing to do that is not an option.;Eddie Vedder;dad

I remember those guys out there as monsters - they were the biggest things I've ever seen!;Kyle Chandler;dad
When you're shooting a film, you really don't get to be a dad, and you don't really get to be a husband. You don't really exist at all. But I do drag my family with me on location whenever I can.;Eric Bana;dad
I have a theory that I really want my kids to know - the only coloration that they make between dad being in films and reality is just a lot of people doing a lot of hard work.;Eric Bana;dad
I hate being clean-shaven. My daughter gets very upset if I shave and says, 'Bring back the spikes, Dad.';Eric Bana;dad

My role model is my dad.;Seann William Scott;dad
My dad liked to boil a squirrel head and suck the brains out the nose. Smaller than a chicken, bigger than a rat.;Beth Ditto;dad
My mother told me Homer Ditto was not my father. Nope. Mom had had a fling with some other guy who was my dad. Some dude who didn't stick around too long who Mom was happy to get rid of. She chose Homer, and Homer chose me, so he lent me his name even though I didn't have his blood.;Beth Ditto;dad
If my Dad doesn't like you, you will know. My Mom is just too innocent to ever lie. She doesn't even cuss.;Channing Tatum;dad

I am quite strict as a dad but I don't want to be censorious.;Nick Clegg;dad
My dad's side of the family had lots of artists and musicians. There's an emotional, quite sentimental quality to Slavic culture. It's very open, it loves art, it loves music, it loves literature. It's very warm, it's very up, it's very down. I would celebrate that.;Nick Clegg;dad
I say this as a young dad seeing children going into primary school: I don't think we should underestimate the formative effect on a child of those first years in primary school.;Nick Clegg;dad
When I was really little I would sit in the back of my dad's car when he'd be playing old-school music. He'd turn down the music and turn around and I'd be singing and know all of the words but I didn't even know how to talk. From then on I've always wanted to be a singer.;Leona Lewis;dad
I do love a bit of fashion. I grew up around a lot of it as my mum and dad had clothing stores so my mum was always designing a lot, and I definitely had that as an influence.;Leona Lewis;dad
My dad is such a good man. You know how when you are a child you think your dad is invincible? Well, I still think that - he is so wise and everything I do I ask my dad's advice about first.;Leona Lewis;dad
I feel like I've lived quite a sheltered life, like my mom and dad were quite protective of me.;Leona Lewis;dad

My dad was a baggage handler at Heathrow and careful with money. He worked hard and had three jobs when I was young. I wish I'd inherited his care for money. Sadly, I've grown up to be rather scatty when it comes to finances.;Gary Numan;dad
Before breaking into music, I had various jobs: forklift driver, driving a courier. But I was forced into working rather than doing it off my own bat because that was my dad's way: you got a job and paid your way.;Gary Numan;dad
I have one brother, John, an airline pilot, who is seven years younger. He's adopted, though we're still blood related - he's my cousin. My parents couldn't have any more children after me, so when Dad's brother died, they adopted John, then just a baby.;Gary Numan;dad
I met Gemma, my wife, when she was 12. She had a schoolgirl crush on me and her dad had arranged for her to meet me. Later, she started coming to my concerts, but I only got to know her well after her mother died. I rang to see how she was, and that's how it started.;Gary Numan;dad
My dad is like a cactus - introverted and tough. I'm a people person, like my mom, but I got my competitiveness from my dad. He came to this country from Belarus with nothing and built a real business. He's my hero for giving me that need to run a business and for having enormous confidence in me.;Gary Vaynerchuk;dad
I'm concerned a little bit with the culture of celebrating the fundraise. My dad taught me that when you borrow money it's the worst day of your life.;Gary Vaynerchuk;dad

People who build family businesses are not classically trained. They have to deal with an enormous amount of politics. You think corporate politics are tough? Go work for your dad or your mom.;Gary Vaynerchuk;dad
My parents were kind of over protective people. Me and my sister had to play in the backyard all the time. They bought us bikes for Christmas but wouldn't let us ride in the street, we had to ride in the backyard. Another Christmas, my dad got me a basketball hoop and put it in the middle of the lawn! You can't dribble on grass.;Jimmy Fallon;dad
My mom grew up in poverty in Oklahoma - like Dust Bowl, nine people in one room kind of place - and the way she got out of poverty was through education. My dad grew up without a dad, with very little and he also made his way out through education.;Jennifer Garner;dad

My dad had this philosophy that if you tell children they're beautiful and wonderful then they believe it, and they will be. So I never thought I was unattractive. But I was never one of the girls at school who had lots of boyfriends.;Emily Mortimer;dad
It's a complex relationship when your dad happened to be president and you are president and then you have all the amateur psychology that goes on when people try to speculate about motivations.;Jeb Bush;dad
My guess is my brother would call his mom and his dad pretty regularly, a lot more than I probably did.;Jeb Bush;dad
I'm lucky because my dad taught me to be frugal and save. And that's important because I want to know that I don't have to take an acting job for two or three years if I don't want to and that I'll still be able to make my house and car payments and buy food for my dogs.;Ashley Greene;dad
My mom and dad just loved the fact that I fooled around. They just embraced it. They'd always kind of enjoy it, and they liked it when I made them laugh.;Dominic Monaghan;dad

When I started writing, I did have some idealised notion of my dad as a writer. But I have less and less of a literary rivalry with him as I've gone on. I certainly don't feel I need his approval, although maybe that's because I'm confident that I've got it.;Paul Theroux;dad
It was, you know, probably 80 degrees out in L.A., and my dad took me outside and there was snow. At the time, I thought, 'Every kid doesn't have snow in their backyard on Christmas?';Tori Spelling;dad
I'd like to play Matt Damon's daddy. He's a wonderful actor, I really admire him, and I'd like to play his dad one day.;Larry Hagman;dad
The one thing that kept our family together was the music. The only thing that our family would share emotionally was to have our dad cry over something the kids did with music.;Dennis Wilson;dad

It's just really making sure I am doing the best job I can do as a dad. I do think that is my No. 1 job.;Tony Dungy;dad

Becoming a dad means you have to be a role model for your son and be someone he can look up to.;Wayne Rooney;dad
I was lucky to have my dad in my life. As crazy as things got, I always had him to put his hand on my shoulder.;Sharon Stone;dad
Within our culture, every school has a swimming pool. We lived on the coast. People swam in the surf. It's a very sporty nation and at that particular time anyone who had an artistic bent was very much an outsider. So if you liked reading or ideas or playing the piano then your dad viewed you as a sissy, basically.;Geoffrey Rush;dad
My dad always taught me to never be satisfied, to want more and know that what is done is done.;Thierry Henry;dad
So much of my aesthetic was formed by my dad.;Ron Perlman;dad
My dad wanted to name me after Rainier Maria Rilke, the poet.;Rainn Wilson;dad

The founder of the Mona Foundation actually knew my dad for years, and the more I learned about it, the more I realized I really found the perfect charity. It sponsors schools and educational initiatives all over the planet.;Rainn Wilson;dad
I had bohemian parents in Seattle in the last '60s living in a houseboat. My dad wrote science fiction novels and painted big murals and oil paintings.;Rainn Wilson;dad
As a father now, I wouldn't do what my dad did, because it left me feeling emotionally unstable as a kid. But he didn't do the things he did out of selfishness or malice.;Anthony Kiedis;dad
I know my dad is a big Internet freak, and he's been known to be a Wikileaker.;Anthony Kiedis;dad
In a school where everyone is famous or rich or whatever, you have a culture, 'What does your dad do?' 'What does your mom do?';Cynthia Nixon;dad
I think 'Family Guy' and 'American Dad' have definitely staked out their own style and territory, and now the accusations are coming that 'The Simpsons' is taking jokes from 'Family Guy.' And I can tell you, that ain't the case.;Matt Groening;dad
I grew up in the world of bad television, on my dad's sets and then as a young schmuck on dating shows and so on.;George Clooney;dad
My mum always told me I was precious, while my dad always told me I was worthless. I think that's a good grounding for a balanced life.;Alan Cumming;dad
I used to have a silk dressing gown an uncle bought in Japan and when I came downstairs in it, my dad used to call me Davinia. There was never embarrassment about that kind of thing. My sister used to dress me up a lot. She thought I was a little doll.;David Walliams;dad
I think it's easiest to teach by example. My dad didn't tell us to work hard we just saw how hard he worked. I know I have shortcomings - like a short fuse - but I've learned you can't come home from a long day of work and snap at the kids.;Chris O'Donnell;dad
I had lost relationships with my dad, my brother and sister and I was just like, you know what, this is definitely the time to just get it together and so that's what I did.;Nicole Richie;dad
You know, I'm just - I'm really happy for my dad.;Nicole Richie;dad
I had the opportunity to go to law school, and my dad, who was an accountant, couldn't believe I wanted to walk away from that and start cooking.;Curtis Stone;dad
Now that I'm a dad, I'm practicing what I call 'one- handed cooking,' because I've got something more important in my other arm. I'm whipping up lots of frittatas and omelets.;Curtis Stone;dad
My dad has been married to his wife for 15 years and wherever he goes there better be a seat for her. I like real couples that tell you how to get through on Wednesdays when you're just at the end of your rope - the ones who really know how to make it through. We have to stop looking at Hollywood couples because you're going to get disappointed.;Sherri Shepherd;dad
My sisters have been baptized and my dad is a deacon at his church now. Sadly my mother passed away but what I can say is that the Jehovah Witnesses took very good care of her up until she died.;Sherri Shepherd;dad
My dad worked two jobs and moved us to the suburbs, and just being a black person, I went through a lot of racism and being called names and being bullied every single day. And it was hard. I didn't have any friends.;Sherri Shepherd;dad
I listened to the radio, so I was influenced by everyone from Michael Jackson to Milli Vanilli. But thankfully my dad had a collection of Cat Stevens albums while my mom was listening to jazz.;Jason Mraz;dad

I was into all kinds of music as a teen - country music, because my dad was in a band that played country, and whatever my sister and brother were into.;Martina McBride;dad
My dad was a huge country music fan, but he also had a band and he sang. So he'd listen to a lot of music and the songs that he'd learn for the band were more from the male artists. So my earliest country memories were Waylon Jennings, Conway Twitty, George Jones, Johnny Paycheck even.;Martina McBride;dad
I never saw my dad cry. My son saw me cry. My dad never told me he loved me, and consequently I told Scott I loved him every other minute. The point is, I'll make less mistakes than my dad, my sons hopefully will make less mistakes than me, and their sons will make less mistakes than their dads.;James Caan;dad
Me and my dad are friends. We're cool. I'll never be disappointed again, because I don't expect anything anymore from him. I just let him exist, and that's how we get along.;Drake;dad
My dad's family were pretty working class, actually.;Dan Stevens;dad
My dad tells me that he took us to a pantomime when I was very, very small - panto being a sort of English phenomenon.

I was too young to remember this, but my dad says that I was running up onstage before they even asked us.;Dan Stevens;dad
My dad liked a lot of Motown, but I didn't listen to it until my teenage years.;John Legend;dad
I love my mom and dad.;Taylor Momsen;dad

There's a lot of research behind the scenes that you don't get to see, but I have an instinct that my dad nurtured from when I was born. I was very lucky then.;Steve Irwin;dad

My dad used to draw these great cartoon figures. His dream was being a cartoonist, but he never achieved it, and it kind of broke my heart. I think part of my interest in art had to do with his yearning for something he could never have.;Kathryn Bigelow;dad
My grandfather had two boys, my uncle had three boys, my dad had me and my two brothers, each of my brothers have had two boys. Then something happened with the chromosomal experiment and suddenly I've got three girls.;Greg Kinnear;dad
My dad had this rock hard body and would work 12- to 13-hour days. The guys he worked with were scrap-iron guys. Nobody on that road crew had read a book in 10 years, but there was something about the way they lived I really admired.;Richard Russo;dad
A company that pays attention to the family unit is a successful company. We don't isolate the family. We don't make rides that say, 'Hey mom, dad, you go sit on the bench.';Michael Eisner;dad
My dad was rubbish at all other aspects of his financial life, but he's pretty good at paying the rent.;Robert Carlyle;dad
I've always taken my love of children from my father. He was a children magnet. Suddenly, having my first child hit home what my dad went through.;Robert Carlyle;dad
My memories are of my dad taking me to football on Saturday mornings, and my mum taking me swimming. Those are the things I remember from my childhood, not sitting around the table debating capitalism and the profit squeeze.;David Miliband;dad
My dad was a ham, too. He could sell those women anything. Of all his sons, I was the only one he could trust to sell as well as he could. I was proud of that.;Paul Lynde;dad
Politicians... talk in generalities and lies, and I think they've caused all our grief. They're so awful, they're really funny. I hate thinking this because my dad loved politics.;Paul Lynde;dad
My mom's a social worker, and my dad works in non-profit organisations.;Seth Rogen;dad
After graduating from flares and platforms in the early 1970s, I started drama school wearing a pair of khaki dungarees with one of my Dad's Army shirts, accessorised by a cat's basket doubling as a handbag. Very Lady Gaga.;Jenny Eclair;dad
I've just got crap hair. Although I inherited a lot of stuff from my dad, including giant knees, I didn't get his good, thick hair. I got my mother's thin, wispy, non-event hair instead.;Jenny Eclair;dad
I was into the Mets because my Dad worked at IBM where he got free Mets tickets, so I was into the Mets... then I got to 'Saturday Night Live' where my boss has unbelievable N.Y. Yankees tickets, so he invites us to the games. I'm going to all the games, so I might as well root for the team I'm gonna go sit with.;Jimmy Fallon;dad
I always wanted to be a stay-at-home dad making art, making movies.;Robert Rodriguez;dad
In high school I dated a white woman. She would come to visit me on the rez. And her dad, who was very racist, didn't like that at all. And he told her one time, 'You shouldn't go on the rez if you're white because Indians have a lot of anger in their heart.';Sherman Alexie;dad
When I was a kid, my step dad started this business and would go out and get lost cows and stuff. He was part-time truck driver, farmer and cowboy. He taught me how to ride from an early age.;Tim McGraw;dad
I haven't really decided to be an actor yet! I started doing plays when I was about 15 or 16. I only did it because my dad saw a bunch of pretty girls in a restaurant and he asked them where they came from and they said drama group. He said, 'Son, that is where you need to go.';Robert Pattinson;dad
My dad says he likes to bask in my glow.;Robert Pattinson;dad
I grew up with baseball I played in Little League and went to games with my dad. But I, as I grew up, became more of a basketball fanatic than a baseball one.;Jonah Hill;dad
My mom was a professional. My dad and mom met each other in a movie called 'New Faces of 1937.' My mom went under the name Thelma Leeds, and she did a few movies, and she was really a great singer, and when she married my dad and started to have a family, she sang at parties.;Albert Brooks;dad
I love being a dad, it keeps me fit and inspired and children are so funny. They always supply you with acting material!;Wesley Snipes;dad
My first outdoor cooking memories are full of erratic British summers, Dad swearing at a barbecue that he couldn't put together, and eventually eating charred sausages, feeling brilliant.;Jamie Oliver;dad
I want any excuse to come home. My dad is not a spring chicken any more. If anyone says, 'Go buy a postage stamp in London,' I'll go and do it.;Emily Mortimer;dad
We all have experiences in our lives that change us, and we all learn from people, like my dad, but at the end of the day, it's only us. And we're only responsible to make ourselves happy.;Tom Brady;dad

I've become a less brave traveller since I became a dad, but in the past I was more foolhardy than brave.;David Mitchell;dad
My dad was working abroad, in Iraq, and he was a doctor. We used to go and visit him, in Baghdad, off and on. For the first ten years of my life, we used to go backwards and forwards to Baghdad, so that was quite amazing. I spent a lot of time traveling around the Middle East.;Andy Serkis;dad
I stayed in Baghdad every summer until I was 14. My dad's sister is still there, but many of my relatives have managed to get out. People forget that there are still people there who are not radicalized in any particular direction, trying to live normal lives in a very difficult situation.;Andy Serkis;dad
My mom and dad got divorced when I was very young, and growing up in a family where the head of the household wasn't a man made a big difference.;Dave Mustaine;dad

My dad had a personal style which was very attractive. It was quite reserved and quite elegant, and it was infectious.;Bill Nighy;dad
Every kid needs to say, 'I want what my mom and dad have.';Josh McDowell;dad

My dad was an absentee dad, so it was always important to me that I was part of my daughter's life, and she deserved two parents, which is part of the rationale behind us staying married for 30 years.;Samuel L. Jackson;dad
My senior year of high school, when I was getting recruited for college, my dad goes to me, 'You can become an Olympic champion.' And that's the first time that I'd heard someone else say that to me. I was like, 'Uh, are you talking to me?';Ryan Lochte;dad
The worst advice I ever received from my dad was to play by the book.;Dimebag Darrell;dad
The only time I think about life beyond F1 is when I contemplate becoming a dad. But there's no way that's going to happen while I'm still racing. To be successful in F1 you need to be very selfish in lots of ways and you're away from home for long periods. That's not the kind of father I want to be.;Jenson Button;dad
But you know, my dad called me the laziest white kid he ever met. When I screamed back at him that he was putting down a race of people to call me lazy, his answer was that's not what he was doing, and that I was also the dumbest white kid he ever met.;Norman Lear;dad
My dad said: 'It looks like you'll be world No.1 in a few hours and I wanted to be the first to say congratulations.';Lee Westwood;dad

I had never said, 'dad, I love you.';Michael Reagan;dad

I came from somewhat of a musical family. I had an uncle on Broadway. My dad kind of knows how to play instruments. Although, I always find it annoying when he does play an instrument.;Nate Ruess;dad

I grew up in Texas, and people love their American-made muscle cars there. I grew up around people who loved cars and took care of cars and my dad's a big car nut, so I learned a little bit about cars - how to love them, most importantly. I think that from the time I could remember, I've always envisioned myself in a vintage muscle car.;Amber Heard;dad
When I used to do musical theatre, my dad refused to come backstage. He never wanted to see the props up close or the sets up close. He didn't want to see the magic.;Nia Vardalos;dad
My mother's a psychologist, my stepfather's a psychologist, my stepmother is a therapist and my dad's a lawyer. So it was all prominent in my life. I don't know anyone who doesn't know someone on some form of prescription medicine.;Zach Braff;dad
As a kid who wasn't into sports, at school I felt almost alienated at times, whereas in the theatre community there was this amazing sense of camaraderie. Early on, we would go to rehearsals with my dad and I was like the mascot for the backstage crew. That was a big part of my childhood, so I dreamed of one day doing a play in London.;Zach Braff;dad
It was tough at the time but when I was younger, my Dad. I would say my Dad, because without him I wouldn't have been here. I mean it was tough for me because he was really demanding. With him, it was never enough, you know, anything I did was never enough.;Thierry Henry;dad
My dad said, 'The thing that I was told that was really helpful was that I mustn't be afraid of the things I was afraid of when I was five years old'.

When I was growing up my mother would say, 'Your dad may have to learn about being a father because he lost his own and that would have affected him'.;Tom Hooper;dad
I feel connected to the Second World War because my father lost his father in that war. So, through my dad and the effect it had on him of losing his father young, I always felt connected to the war. It goes back years, but it still feels to me as if we're completely living in it.;Tom Hooper;dad
I'm a military kid, both parents in the military - Mom did 12 years, Dad did 21, served in two wars. So discipline is something that was huge.;Robert Griffin III;dad
One thing my dad always told me, was he would make sure I always had what he didn't have. He couldn't play basketball because he didn't have tennis shoes - so I had five pairs of tennis shoes.;Robert Griffin III;dad
You always give credit where credit is due - to high school coaches, college coaches - but my dad, the foundation that he built with me, is where all of this came from. The speed, the determination, the mindset, just the natural belief that you can do anything you put your mind to, it all comes from my dad.;Robert Griffin III;dad
I don't know much about only children. I was the middle one of three, and if ever I was alone with mum and dad, it was a rare moment.;Elizabeth Hurley;dad

Dad taught us about morals, values and goals. Having a tight-knit family was important to him.;Junior Seau;dad

The only ones I trust really are my Mum and Dad and those who are closest to me.;Katie Price;dad
My dad said if you become a tennis professional just make sure you get into the top hundred, because you have to make a little bit of money. You make a living so you can pay your coaching and, you know, your travels.;Roger Federer;dad
Money stress is what used to remind me of my Dad most.;Ted Rall;dad
My dad was the manager at the 45,000-acre ranch, but he owned his own 1,200-acre ranch, and I owned four cattle that he gave to me when I graduated from grammar school, from the eighth grade. And those cows multiplied, and he kept track of them for years for me. And that was my herd.;Dave Brubeck;dad
My dad's not here, but he's watching in heaven.;Bubba Watson;dad
My dad was a diplomat and after living in America, where I was born, he was posted to Cairo.;Arabella Weir;dad
My dad was depressed a lot of the time, and there were a lot of things in his life that he never resolved.;Juliana Hatfield;dad
I'd love to be a dad. I hope I'd be great at it. That's every man's fear, yet his most important job.;Matt Damon;dad

When dad told me Mr Steptoe had passed away, I broke down.;Louise Brown;dad

I knew I was going to be a journalist when I was eight years old and I saw the printing presses rolling at the Sydney newspaper where my dad worked as a proofreader.;Geraldine Brooks;dad
My dad's a scratch golfer and I've got the knack of seeing something and then replicating it. I saw my dad swing a club and I worked out how to do the same thing. My backswing and follow-through have been basically the same since I was two.;Rory McIlroy;dad
My mom and dad worked very hard to give me the best chance in - not just in golf but in life. You know, I was an only child, you know, my dad worked three jobs at one stage. My mom worked night shifts in a factory.;Rory McIlroy;dad
I wanted to make a point of basing myself at home, being close to my family. I'll never be able to repay Mum and Dad for what they did, but at least they know they'll never have to work another day. I'll do whatever it takes to look after them.;Rory McIlroy;dad
Dad and mom would have preferred that I be a doctor, a lawyer, a scientist, or a great humanitarian.;Levon Helm;dad
My dad and I played music. He teaches me a song or two every time I'm home.;Levon Helm;dad

I'm the fun dad, I am also the disciplinarian.;Johnny Knoxville;dad
You know my dad pushed me to believe that I was going to be the best. I just never thought of life without tennis, even looking forward.;Andre Agassi;dad
My dad was this sort of avant-garde guy who did all kinds of weird things. He was a true original and anybody who met him never forgot him.;Paul Thomas Anderson;dad
I'm into being a dad, that's where my focus is most of the time. I'm an actor that's my job, but it's not my life. I have a lot of other interests too.;Paul Walker;dad
We busted a lot of family secrets with this. But to make a long story short, my parents relationship was built heavily on security issues for my Mom, and when my Dad couldn't provide security, the relationship unraveled.;Kenny Loggins;dad
My dad taught me to play bass. He's a bass player he still plays in a band in Michigan to this day. He taught me to play bass when I was about 6. I used to just go to band practice with him, and whoever didn't show up for rehearsal that day, I would take their spot.;Mayer Hawthorne;dad
My dad calls me 'Mac' a lot, from 'Mike Tyson's Punch Out' - Little Mac is the main character. I was obsessed. I can still beat Mike Tyson on 'Punch Out.';Mayer Hawthorne;dad
I don't think I've had a holiday in my entire life that wasn't about my dad's work.;Kat Dennings;dad
I want to stay healthy, keep fit, eat well, keep a low profile and be a good dad.;Frank Bruno;dad
OK, so my parents were married in 1955 and my mom knew my dad was gay and my dad knew he was gay and so I was, like, 'Why in the heck did you get married?' Like, what was going on? What was that time? It's like this crazy paradox that my whole life is based on, or my family's based on. So I spent a lot of time trying to understand '55.;Mike Mills;dad
My dad's gay experiences really had a very positive influence on me and my straight relationships - how to better accept all the weirdness and ambiguity and ups and downs and paradoxes. I knew from the beginning I was writing about love.;Mike Mills;dad
I think my dad is the only Arabic descendent who is an unsuccessful businessman.;Shakira;dad
When my father died in my arms it had such a profound affect on me that at that very moment when my dad passed I realized that I needed to face my own fears.;Criss Angel;dad

When I was a boy, I used to pull a big cross saw with my dad. He'd use his right hand, so I'd have to use my left.;Joe Frazier;dad
I've got a really great family round me, two sisters and an older brother and my mum and dad. Everybody's equal.;Nicholas Hoult;dad
My mum was raised Jewish, my dad is very scientifically minded, and my school was vaguely Christian. We sang hymns in school. I liked the hymns bit, but apart from that, I can take it or leave it. So I had lots of different influences when I was younger.;Ben Barnes;dad
My dad is a doctor, a professor of psychiatry, and my mum is a psychotherapist.;Ben Barnes;dad
I often talk with other actors about that time when you've just finished a job, because I think you do take on the characteristics of some of the characters you play. Sometimes it can be a great thing and sometimes it's a bit haunting because you're not quite sure how to leave it on set. My dad talks about it as being 'de-personalised.';Ben Barnes;dad
My dad was a Marine. He was one of the Montford Point Marines. Those are the equivalent of the Tuskegee Airmen for Marines. He's a tough, tough guy. When I was 15 we had a fight, and I didn't speak to him for 10 years.;Larry Elder;dad
My mom and my dad were married 56 years, and the fact that I reconciled with my dad I think made their marriage a little bit better as well.;Larry Elder;dad

My dad? He died when I was 19, which is a bad time for your dad to die, because there's an awful lot of things you have to resolve with your parents past your teens if you've been a difficult teenager.;Robbie Coltrane;dad
More and more couples are having this negotiation or discussion, but I'm still amazed at the number who aren't and where the cultural norm sort of kicks in and they just assume that mom's got to be the one who stays home, not dad.;James Levine;dad
My parents moved to American Samoa when I was three or four years old. My dad was principal of a high school there. It was idyllic for a kid. I had a whole island for a backyard. I lived there until I was eight years old and we moved to Santa Barbara.;Eric Stoltz;dad
Parents don't understand kids and kids don't understand parents. My parents were divorced when I was really young and I went to live with my dad.;Mark Hoppus;dad
My grandfather was a lawyer, my dad was a lawyer, my mum was a lawyer, I got an uncle who's a lawyer, I got cousins that are lawyers.;Benicio Del Toro;dad

My dad is a nurse midwife, one of about only 50 male midwives in the U.S., I think.;Matthew Morrison;dad
I'm the most inappropriate dad. I curse in front of my kids and their friends. I let my kids watch R-rated movies. I'll walk by the movie theater and say, 'Let's go see that,' and my kids will say, 'No, it's rated R. It's not appropriate for kids.' I'm like Uncle Dad. We have fun. I don't live with them, but I drive over four days a week.;Marlon Wayans;dad
I think I had kind of an advantage. When I was growing up, my dad had just got out of jail and he had a great record collection. He had - it was all - these were the songs. So I heard a lot of these songs, like, my whole life, so for me it was easy. I already knew what I was going to sing.;Chris Isaak;dad
My mom and dad played this music all the time when I was growing up, so to me songs by Jerry Lee and Fats Domino are the classics, they're the best songs ever.;Chris Isaak;dad
I can definitely tell when mum has got money because then she likes to go shopping to spend it, whereas dad is steadier and avoids splurges. I like to think I've inherited both sides.;Sophie Ellis-Bextor;dad
You know not having my real dad around and having a step dad made me want to be a great dad. So now I have been one for 9 years. And now 3 daughters. So, that is what I am - a dad, first and foremost, before anything else. It's just something that comes natural now.;Tim McGraw;dad
My dad has been a big influence on me, because he's always had his own business. He really taught me business sense and how to be a focused individual, but also how to have fun and make everyone around you have fun.;Wiz Khalifa;dad
I love to cook. My dad's a really excellent cook and his style is: Look in the fridge and make whatever there is with whatever ingredients you have and I like cooking like that, too.;Olivia Thirlby;dad
I could not tell you the date of my mother's death. I could not tell you the date of my dad's death. These are not dates that I find significant.;O. J. Simpson;dad
My Dad hated his job. He sold overcoats, but he wanted to make movies. He had a failed career working with the Ritz Brothers - they were like the Marx Brothers, only a tier below. I always had a picture in my mind of him in a straw hat.;Steve Sabol;dad
People who have not done their research on me do not know that I am European, born in Copenhagen, Denmark to an Italian father from Napoli and a mother from Alabama who was singing opera and went to Europe, met my dad, fell in love, and then moved back to Rome, where I was raised, between Rome and Hamburg.;Giancarlo Esposito;dad
I have always had the feeling I could do anything and my dad told me I could. I was in college before I found out he might be wrong.;Ann Richards;dad

My dad saw my husband's boss at a conference, and he said to stop paying my husband until we produce children.;Jenna Bush;dad
I'm more like my father, personality-wise. But my mom and I get alone really well - obviously, because my mom and my dad get along so well.;Jenna Bush;dad
I'm sure there were times when I wish I had thought, 'Gosh, that might really embarrass mom and dad,' but our parents didn't raise us to think about them. They're very selfless and they wanted us to have as normal of a college life as possible. So really, we didn't think of any repercussions.;Jenna Bush;dad
In the 'Garnethill' trilogy, people always forget that Maureen O'Donnell's dad was a journalist and she did art history at uni and her brother did law, but no-one ever thinks they're middle-class - they're just working class because they speak with accents.;Denise Mina;dad
There's been times when I've had heartbreaking moments and I'm like, 'I can't believe you said that,' or 'I can't believe you did that'. And it hurts, it still hurts, and it'll always hurt, but I've never had somebody that I truly cared about just walk out on me, whether it was a boyfriend, or an aunt, mom or dad.;Shailene Woodley;dad
My parents were involved in everything I did. They were showbiz people themselves. My dad was an actor. They were parents they did what parents are supposed to do.;Tina Yothers;dad

I grew up in a small town in Illinois, and my dad was a basketball coach. Thanks to him, I have excellent fundamentals in both basketball and baseball.;Nick Offerman;dad
I went to my dad when I was 17 and said, 'I want to be a country music star.' Which every dad loves to hear. And he said, 'I want you to go to college.' So we had a discussion. And I'm pretty stubborn. I'm a lot like him. And he said, 'If you go to college and graduate, I'll pay your first six months of rent in Nashville.' So he bribed me.;Eric Church;dad
That is where the irony of the film comes off, in terms of the language it employs - where he tries desperately to be a 'TV Dad,' to give advice and it's so pat it becomes ridiculous.;Atom Egoyan;dad
My dad is a bank president and my mom was an accountant and they didn't think that seeking the life of a freelance writer was very practical, you see. Of course, I was just as determined to do it.;Kevin J. Anderson;dad
I'm going to take care of the man I'm with. I grew up in a household where my mum takes care of my dad - she cooks, she does everything - and that's the kind of girl I am.;Nicole Scherzinger;dad
My dad came out of the Roosevelt era and the Depression. One person and one party made a difference in his life. That's what everybody forgot when they called my father and other people political bosses.;Richard M. Daley;dad
I have found having my dad as my North Star has worked well for me.;Tony Parsons;dad

My mom's been married three times my dad has been married a lot. I didn't really see my dad that much.;Skeet Ulrich;dad

My dad is a very quick-witted, sarcastic, dry, humorous guy, whereas my mom's very silly, and that side of the family is very musical.;Tim Heidecker;dad

I know exactly where I've come from, I know exactly who my mum and dad are.;Christopher Eccleston;dad
I remember opening my dad's closet and there were, like, 40 suits, every color of the rainbow, plaid and winter and summer. He had two jewelry boxes full of watches and lighters and cuff links. And just... he was that guy. He was probably unfulfilled in his life in many ways.;Jon Hamm;dad

A large part of my life revolves around my dad. Sometimes, I even feel a strong sense of connection, something very tangible when I learn something new in the martial arts.;Brandon Lee;dad

Like my dad, I have a Christmas party most years. I like to celebrate and see as many people as possible.;Lauren Graham;dad

I'm trying to have my own thing, and I don't know if it's even possible. I didn't realize so many people actually think I'm trying to be like my dad. I read comments like 'She's no Elvis.' I'm not trying to be. I never set out to be.;Lisa Marie Presley;dad
My mum and dad had worked incredibly hard to afford me an education.;Benedict Cumberbatch;dad

My dad has always been my coach. And I've spent so much time with him. So he's one of my best friends. And I can talk to him about everything.;Caroline Wozniacki;dad

The satisfaction you get when you finally beat your dad is amazing, that rush of adrenaline.;Lee Westwood;dad
I think he would have been proud and smiling... when we laid him to rest because his family was together. I think that was a great gift to be able to give Dad at the end.;Michael Reagan;dad

I didn't always want to be a dad.;Liam Gallagher;dad

Growing up, I didn't give my grandfather's photography a second thought. I wasn't involved in his work, except that I helped my dad print his negatives.;Kim Weston;dad

My dad took me to all the best rock and punk shows when I was growing up and music has always been a part of my life. So I'm very interested in the music scene and I suppose that's why I've ended up going out with musicians. Dave Pirner is still one of my best friends.;Winona Ryder;dad
My parents are very hard working people who did everything they could for their children.

When my dad needed a shirt ironed, he would yell downstairs to my mother, who would drop everything and iron his shirt.;Hope Davis;dad

When I was on Broadway when I was little, I remember always driving through Times Square with my dad to the theater. Now when I go back, you can't even drive on Broadway in the 40s. New Times Square is too touristy to me.;Jenna Ushkowitz;dad

If I have a problem, stuff's going through my head, I feel like using, I usually go and talk to my dad... I decided to get sober a lot younger than he did. He first tried to get sober when he was like 32, I believe.;Jack Osbourne;dad

My dad was a golden gloves boxer in the Marine Corps, then a deputy sheriff. My mom worked as an office assistant.;Susana Martinez;dad

I remember once giving my dad some drawings and writings and said, 'If you could just give these to the publisher, that would be great.' And I was about five!;Sally Hawkins;dad

My mom and dad met at UCLA when he as a captain in the Air Force and she was in her junior year.;Tracy Austin;dad

My dad left when I was 3 1/2, and he left my mom and I.;David Cassidy;dad
As a father, I do everything my dad didn't do. My son Beau's birth changed my life.;David Cassidy;dad

Well, for one thing, you know my dad was a cop.;Edward Burns;dad
My dad used to say to me, 'You look more like me than I do.';Dhani Harrison;dad
I did rebel. I was the rebel in my family, because my dad wanted me to go and just travel with him.;Dhani Harrison;dad

I don't really plan to be a pop star I just want to be able to make music without the whole My Dad thing hanging over me, which everyone in my position goes through.;Dhani Harrison;dad

'Keep your head down at school.' Those are sage words from my dad. They kept me in check for years.;Dhani Harrison;dad
Playing music has always felt very natural. You know, you do try to do other things, and you do learn lessons that way, but, eventually - well... if your dad is a plumber, you become a plumber. It's the family business, and I felt like I was taking over the family business.;Dhani Harrison;dad
I never really saw my dad around when the Iron Maiden and the AC/DC were playing. But he knew what I was doing. I was just absorbing music. So he just kind of left me to my own devices.;Dhani Harrison;dad
I did Albert Hall, I got to play the Hall of Fame with Prince. So I've done that kind of stuff for ages.

I owe a lot to my dad, just for having provided the wrestling business for us to get into.;Owen Hart;dad

My dad always told me that anyone's voice is just another instrument added to the music.;T-Pain;dad
David and Dad didn't get along too well growing up. I mean we all got along, but it was harder on David, because David wasn't going to be the son that Dad wanted. But now they're like best friends.;Amy Sedaris;dad
Mom and Dad would stay in bed on Sunday morning, but the kids would have to go to church.;Lynn Johnston;dad

My dad was a musician, it was just what he did, like another guy's dad drives a meat truck. Our house was normal. We weren't taken with the fact our dad was a musician.;Branford Marsalis;dad
My dad has a really great record collection that basically went up to the year I was born: 1984.;Ezra Koenig;dad
My dad grew up in a working-class Jewish neighbourhood, and I got a scholarship from my dad's union to go to college. I went there to get an education, not as an extension of privilege.;Ezra Koenig;dad
My dad was a musician. He was a singer and he played the guitar, so music was always around.;Kris Allen;dad
I've always wanted to be a dad.;Kris Allen;dad
My first memory of the Rolling Stones is listening to 'Satisfaction' at a sixth-grade slumber party at a friend's house in Ankara, Turkey, where my family was living at the time. In the middle of our sleepover, my friend's dad stopped the record when he heard the words 'girlie action!';Gayle King;dad
My dad used to say, 'You have to become part of the machine to beat the machine,' and there's some validity in it. But honestly, even when I'm inside the machine, you still see me. I stick out a little bit.;Michael Shannon;dad
Your kids can say some cruel things to you at times. For example, Nicole, Miles and Sofie are standing there in the room and I'm dressed to kill in my own mind.

My dad has always been extremely supportive in every decision I've made and much more interested in me picking what I wanted to do.;Colin Hanks;dad
I knew that I needed to do something that I desperately loved. There was a period where I did question if it was acting because I knew that I would be making things hard on myself. I knew that there was going to be a little bit of a hullabaloo because of my dad being who he is and all that.;Colin Hanks;dad
When I was younger it was - you know, my dad dressed up in drag on 'Bosom Buddies.' And that was what I was having to deal with at the time. And then around the time that I was into college was when he became statue-worthy I guess you could say.;Colin Hanks;dad
This is like my dad's race team where we had one Legend car. If we wrecked it, we couldn't race the next week unless we had enough parts to put it back together again.;Kurt Busch;dad
Before, I guess, mum and dad were everything, but now, in my case, I had two new girls and all of a sudden they're completely dependent on you and there's a third generation. It's a funny shift all of a sudden. You have the babies, you have yourself and then you have your parents.;Roger Federer;dad
I was just a kid and I didn't have a dad. That's hard, because when you're a kid, you blame yourself for everything. And I blamed myself for him not being around, for my parents not being together.;Jonathan Rhys Meyers;dad
You can tell your uncle stuff that you could not tell your dad. That is kind of the role of an uncle. I feel very much like a father sometimes but sometimes I feel like a teammate.;Dusty Baker;dad

My dad was great. He was very droll, very dry.;Albert Finney;dad
A lot of times I would go into a room and audition for whatever sitcom it was and they would expect me to do sort of what my dad was doing and I am not him so they would be disappointed and I would feel nervous and not know exactly how to do it.;Jason Ritter;dad
Even if I tried to be my dad, it would be a mediocre, slightly embarrassing version.;Jason Ritter;dad

Now, guitar was pretty cool. Everybody knew something on the guitar. So I wanted to play guitar, but I told my dad if he wanted me to keep studying something, I'd like to study piano.;Jackson Browne;dad
I grew up in Greenwich Village. Dad was friends with John Lennon and Yoko Ono.;Yancy Butler;dad
I think there's nothing better than laughing in life, so that's nice, to be thought of as someone who can make someone laugh. It's 'cause I think life is hard. You know, my dad was a really silly man. A great Irish silly man. And that's fine.;Joan Cusack;dad
I'm a dad and that's pretty important.;Todd Akin;dad
My dad was a football player - a soccer player - for Manchester United, and I loved playing football, but I also happened to be the guy in class who was pretty good at sight reading. My teacher gave me scripts, and I was very comfortable.;Ian McShane;dad
Well, Steve Vai joined my dad's band right around the time when I actually started playing guitar. So he gave me a couple of lessons on fundamentals, and gave me some scales and practice things to work on. But I pretty much learned everything by ear.;Dweezil Zappa;dad
And, you know, my dad would show me some things sometimes, but the best things that I got to do were to actually see really good players play up close. That gives you an idea of fingering and technique and what not.;Dweezil Zappa;dad
I liked a lot of the things other people liked - Jimi Hendrix, The Beatles, Van Halen, AC/DC - but if I compared it to my dad's music, there just seemed to be elements missing.;Dweezil Zappa;dad
I didn't really hear any other music other than what my dad was working on until I was 12. My recollection of hearing other music was that I liked some things that I heard but I always thought, 'Where's the rest of it?' It didn't have the same amount of detail or instrumentation or imagination in the arrangements.;Dweezil Zappa;dad
My dad taught me to be a leader or a follower, and he said follower ain't fun. So I want to be the leader of Bubba Watson.;Bubba Watson;dad
I had just lost my dad and I remembered all the songs we used to go and hear at concerts, and the records around the house and sometimes we'd play together.;Vince Gill;dad
The real beauty of it - key to my life was playing key chords on a banjo. For somebody else it may be a golf club that mom and dad put in their hands or a baseball or ballet lessons. Real gift to give to me and put it in writing.;Vince Gill;dad
I'm being a dad and a good husband.;Chad Smith;dad
I'm worried because of my mother, she's going to see my performance and she's quite hard. She's going to see me naked. And my Dad, woah. Yeah, they're going to see me like a woman, you know?;Eva Green;dad
My dad didn't want me to play guitar. He played piano, so I chose that. And I ended up loving it.;Gavin DeGraw;dad

I was a sickly baby, and after two sets of adoptive parents took me home, they returned me to the orphanage because of a serious respiratory infection.

Right now, it hasn't affected my music other than the fact that I don't have time to write any of it. That's no different from when I first started and I lived at home. I would play the guitar in the afternoon and then my mom or my dad would come home and I'd have to quit.;Paul Westerberg;dad
The best thing about being a dad? Well, I think it's just the thing that every man wants - to have a son and heir.;George Best;dad

So I go to my first book signing, and these two girls came up and gave me a piece of paper: '10 reasons you should date our dad. He climbed Mount Kilimanjaro. He's a lawyer.'

I realised I could run after finding out that my dad used to run and it gave me the morale that if he did it then maybe I could also run.;David Rudisha;dad

My mother's incredibly giving, almost too giving at times. And, my dad is a real logical person. He's got logic for every situation. They've been married for 24 years, so there was that stability, also. I really learned to think on my own at a very young age.;Brian Austin Green;dad

Our dad was a great guy and we will never forget him.;Lara St. John;dad

I used to listen to my dad a lot as a way of trying to be close to him, as well, because my parents were divorced and I didn't spend that much time with him. And I used to put headphones on and listen to my dad talk and sing and I found that quite... bonding with him, in a weird way.;Teddy Thompson;dad

I feel that marrying younger and being quite a young dad helped me with the stability of my career.;Patrick Duffy;dad
I worked with my dad for 15 years. I apprenticed under him and decided I wanted to become an architect. So I went to college for it and then the acting bug got me.;Patrick Duffy;dad
Indians mock their corrupt politicians relentlessly, but they regard their honest politicians with silent suspicion.

The best thing I ever learned from my dad was he knew he wasn't the best of singers, but he always knew he was a great entertainer, and I always thought that was a good concept to bring along, that ultimately acting is an entertainment art and you have to be aware of the fact that you want people to be excited to be watching you.;Dean Norris;dad

My dad has always been very proud of me but I think I have exceeded his expectations.

The fact that I'm not doing that means that I'm a huge success.;Jesse Tyler Ferguson;dad
Dad really had little to do with the songs, except to perform them.;Nancy Sinatra;dad

If you met my dad, I think a lot of things would be put to rest. Because my pops is a pretty silly guy. But, Coldcut, they're based in the U.K. I'm a big fan of jazz music, so American music has had a big influence on what I listen to.;Eric San;dad

I'm an ambassador for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, and one of the children, his wish was to go to the Emmys, so he's going to be my date, along with my husband, and my dad and his girlfriend.

My little son, Atticus, desperately needs his dad and I haven't been there for him... and that's sad.;Daniel Baldwin;dad

My dad always said I was hard-headed, that it would take something like that to wake me up spiritually, and I guess it did. My heart had gotten so beat up that I didn't have anything left to give.;Scott Stapp;dad

Going through the grief period of my dad and losing him - that was the worst thing because you know when you get that call. When you are seven, eight years old, you have that almost vision in your mind of what that's going to be like and what your going to feel like and it doesn't prepare you.;Richie Sambora;dad
I love being a dad. I'd have more kids if I could. I'd take a couple more, one or two more before I croak.;Richie Sambora;dad

My dad was an entrepreneurial businessman, and maybe I got some of his ability.;Thomas Jane;dad

For my birthday this year, my girlfriends - who knew I'd just inherited my dad's turntable - gave me a carton of albums like 'Blue Kentucky Girl,' by Emmylou Harris, and 'Off the Wall,' by Michael Jackson. It's all stuff we grew up with. I mean, you can't have a music collection without Prince's 'Purple Rain' - it just can't be done!;Connie Britton;dad

My dad keeps joking about sneaking into my grandparents' house and switching out their HBO for PBS so they think I'm on 'Downton Abbey.';Allison Williams;dad
The best advice my dad ever gave me is that acting is believing. Acting is not acting. It isn't putting on a face and dancing around in a mask. It's believing that you are that character and playing him as if it were a normal day in the life of that character.;Haley Joel Osment;dad
My dad never told me that when you audition, you might not get the role. He wanted to wait until my first disappointment to tell me.;Haley Joel Osment;dad
I was really bright as a kid and tested well, and it was clear that I was going to get scholarships to any schools I wanted. My dad always said I could be an engineer at that time it was the elite of society: steady job, working in science, which was then the answer to every problem we had. It was kind of a mandate. Kind of a dream he had for me.;James Wood;dad
My parents loved each other. I was raised in a house of total love and respect. My dad worked very hard and my mother was incredibly devoted to him. I can unequivocally, without any peradventure of doubt, tell you that I was raised with the kind of love that we only dream of.;James Wood;dad
Dad is my best mate and I can tell Mum absolutely anything. I really appreciate Mum and Dad. Why are we so close? Young parents, I think. The rock business keeps their minds young.;Kim Wilde;dad
I wasn't aware of my dad being an actor when I was young. I remember there was an Australian children's entertainer on television called Ralph Harris and when I'd say my father was an actor, kids would say, you know, 'oh, is he Ralph Harris?' And I had to say no and then they would lose interest.;Jared Harris;dad
He described how, as a boy of 14, his dad had been down the mining pit, his uncle had been down the pit, his brother had been down the pit, and of course he would go down the pit.;Barbara Castle;dad

When I was little, I used to work with my dad on the engine of his car. Mostly this was a matter of me handing him wrenches.;Mireille Enos;dad
My dad is kind of a rascal, like in a Dickensian sense. He just goes from career to career.;Benjamin Walker;dad
My life isn't that dramatic. My dad really loves me, he just can't talk on the phone. He's too crippled and shy, and that's almost harder. He's there and he loves me, and I try and try and try, it's just impossible to have a relationship.;Joey Lauren Adams;dad
I don't deal with death very well. My brother, John Candy, my dad, my mom, Brandon Tartikoff just a couple of weeks ago. I mean, you lose a lot of people in your life, and that's one thing I am constantly working on - pain management.;James Belushi;dad
I don't know if there is a gene for comedy, but my dad was a very funny man. He just didn't know it. He was a naturally funny character, and when my brother and I would laugh at things he said and did, he would say, 'What do you think is so funny?';James Belushi;dad
My dad was in the army so we moved around a lot and I changed schools every year and had to make new friends, and I found that if I was the funny guy I could do that easier.;Jason Gann;dad
I would say the most help I got was from my dad. My dad is a civil engineer in Switzerland he's 90 years old now, so he's no longer active as a civil engineer, but still a very active person.;Claude Nicollier;dad
My dad has no control over who works with me. Me, me and me alone has to take responsibility for anything.;Shane MacGowan;dad

I always wanted to be a father. I have a beautiful relationship with my dad and beautiful memories. I always knew I was going to have a family.;Ricky Martin;dad

My dad served in two wars has been flying airplanes for 60 years now. He was certainly quite an inspiration.;John L. Phillips;dad
I remember my dad, who coached football, would buy some of his players football shoes when they couldn't afford it.;Chaske Spencer;dad
But Dad and I are the only father-and-daughter acts who have both had No. 1 songs in England.;Lily Allen;dad
My dad passed away before my freshman year, and it altered how I thought. I was depressed - I didn't hang out with my friends. I worked through it by dancing.;Heather Morris;dad
My goal is for Gunnar to outlive me. That's the way it should be. My dream is for him to be a dad himself one day, so he can find out all the anxiety that kids bring to their dads.;Boomer Esiason;dad
My dad and grandpa were in the army and as a country singer you're constantly playing at military bases all across the country and meeting soldiers and their families and hearing their stories.;Dierks Bentley;dad
My dad was my first coach and drove me extremely hard from a very young age.;Candace Parker;dad
From my first dunk at 14 years old to my second NCAA Championship at the University of Tennessee, my intense training with my dad was always to credit.;Candace Parker;dad
On my best days, such as when I was a junior in high school coming off a 42-point performance and near triple-double, my dad was there to tell me I haven't arrived yet and bring me back to reality.;Candace Parker;dad
I love playing a dad. It's hard to find family dramas that are genuinely funny.;Peter Gallagher;dad
If a cow walked into this room, I'd probably walk out. I could milk it, but my dad never forced me to do a lot of chores like that, mostly because he loved doing it himself.;Stuart Appleby;dad
My dad is a pilot so I think I was born with the travel bug.;Isabel Lucas;dad
I didn't really get into golf until I was about 14. My mom and dad were taking lessons from a pro an hour and a half from our farm in Cohuna, Australia. When they got home, I'd ask my mom to explain everything they learned - drills and all.;Stuart Appleby;dad
I had my footballing heroes such as Bryan Robson and Diego Maradona but my dad was a rugby league star, and he was my real hero. But the relationship with my mum was rocky and we saw things that would affect any youngster.;Ryan Giggs;dad
A mustache really defines your face. My dad had a mustache when I was growing up, and I can still remember when he shaved it, he looked like a completely different person.;Jason Sudeikis;dad
Some musicians I know are incredible fathers. Like Keith Richards. A fantastic dad.;Jack Bruce;dad
I love Prince Harry. Good looking and a bit of a rebel. Me and his dad are as thick as thieves and I knew Harry before I knew his dad so we've met a few times. I think he's amazing. And I think you can relate to him because he's made mistakes. He's cool.;Cheryl Cole;dad
We all have roles in life. I'm a dad, a husband, this and that, but basically I only feel justified in being alive when I'm on the stage.;Jack Bruce;dad
I have a weird sense of humour. My dad's the same. We love watching 'Monty Python' together.;Miranda Kerr;dad
My grandmother was an actress too. In the thirties and forties she was under contract with Universal Studios. Crazy credits, lots of them. My dad was also under contract with Universal Studios. And my first film was shot on the same stage they both worked on at Universal.;Chris Pine;dad
I got stuck up a tree when I was about seven, and my dad had to come and get the ladder to get me down. I loved to climb all the way up to the top. I must have been a koala in my past life.;Miranda Kerr;dad
No, like I said, my dad was never really part of the tennis. His involvement around what I did with the tennis and with my mom and my grandparents was really not a part of my life.;Jimmy Connors;dad
I've hung out at dozens of playgrounds, bored out of my mind, with not even a look of comfort from disapproving mothers all around me. Either they think I'm a pedophile or a deadbeat dad. That's what I get for being a single dad - suspicious looks at the playground.;Dominic West;dad
My mum's parents were from Ireland, my dad's mum was American-Irish.;Dominic West;dad
Obviously, losing a parent is very difficult. I miss my dad every day, but I know he would be proud to see me continuing to swim and going for another shot at the Olympics.;Eric Shanteau;dad
I actually study boxing - my dad was a Golden Gloves champion so I learned how to fight at a very young age. Growing up in Brooklyn you always had to watch your back, so I pretty much learned to protect myself.;Lana Parrilla;dad
I'd always assumed that I would die at about the same age as my dad - he was 45. I am five years in credit now. I can't get my head around the fact that I am older than he was - ever.;Ian Hislop;dad
I'm a four star general in this thing, and you don't rise to the ranks of a four star general by hanging about the house being the perfect dad.;Sam Elliott;dad
As I get older and I get a few more years experience I become more like Dad, you know, King Lear.;David Crystal;dad
One day when I was like 9, I heard the Beatles on the radio, and I asked my dad who they were. He told me they were the best band in the world, and I became obsessed. He started giving me their albums in sequential order, and I listened to them - and only them - until I was probably in high school.;Lukas Haas;dad
I think people like to think I'm in some way financially dependent on my family - on my dad - but the fact of the matter is I've been emancipated from my father since I was 14 years old. That's something people don't know or understand.;Devon Aoki;dad
My mom grew up in Kansas, my dad in Indiana. They had boring childhoods.;Hunter Parrish;dad
My mom was a dancer, my dad's a singer and I've always had that kind of music in my life.;Elvis Stojko;dad

Mum and dad thought I was going to say I was pregnant. I said oh no, no, I've just been nominated for a Golden Globe. They were like, oh that's lovely, love.;Melissa George;dad
One of the accidental joys of my writing life has been that I've had some lovely, surprisingly good fortune with readers, and I've brought readers to my dad's work. I can't tell you the joy that gives me. Because my father's work was masterful.;Andre Dubus III;dad
Somewhere in my wildest childhood I must have done something right. Being able to make a boyhood dream come true is one thing, but to have a kid come along and thrill his dad like Brett Hull has thrilled me over his career is too much for one guy to handle.;Bobby Hull;dad
My dad and mom divorced when I was around ten, and I didn't live with him after that, though he was close by and we saw each other weekly.

It occurred to me then that my dad was kind of special he's still one of my favorite writers.;Andre Dubus III;dad
The most challenging part of being a dad is self-restraint. So often your instinct is to teach and tell. I am constantly reminding myself to listen to them.;Michael Chiklis;dad
I'm a dad now and whatever I'm doing in life I usually put a lot of effort into it - usually too much effort, so it kind of comes off ridiculous at times.;Jeremy Sisto;dad
I grew up in a big Irish, Catholic family. My dad was a pretty rough guy. So one of my brothers left home when he was 15 and found his way to the gym. It gave me the opportunity to go and spend some time with him and work out in the gym.;Gerry Cooney;dad
I know who my dad is, I've met him a few times, but I don't even call him dad. I know it sounds horrible, but I don't even see him as part of my family, to be honest. If you want the truth, it doesn't bother me because I don't know any different. I just know that me and my mum, that was my family.;Sally Pearson;dad
My folks have played everything from rock, disco, pop, funk, and blues. My dad has always brought and played different genres like jazz, classical, and Latin. With all this in my pocket, I feel I have a taste of everything for my influences.;Haley Reinhart;dad
I love my daughter, but she had me on couscous and fixed me pastas and made me eat oatmeal every morning and what else, turkey burgers, turkey bacon, and that kind of stuff. So she wants her dad to live a long time, and I do, too.;Dusty Baker;dad
It's always been a dream of mine to get somewhere and to have my mom and dad with me up there.;Haley Reinhart;dad
My dad wanted me to play when I was a kid, so I learned to play the guitar. I pursued a career in music because I love it so much and I enjoy what it does to those who hear it.;Randy Travis;dad
I needed to step away from music because the truth was I couldn't be the dad I wanted to be to my kids. My truth was that I could not reconcile the two worlds - the entertainment world and being the dad I wanted to be in the present. You can't substitute time, you just can't.;Corey Hart;dad
All my band members were old enough to be my dad. It was like this family vibe.;Hunter Hayes;dad
Truthfully, I'm still Corey Hart, Dad, first.;Corey Hart;dad
I think that every therapist that I know, including my dad and my sister, have their own issues. But that empathy is what makes them good at their job.;Laura Benanti;dad
Dad worked his entire career as an aviation technician. Mom was a legal secretary who became a teacher. We lived a simple American life.;Brian Sandoval;dad

My dad was a good athlete. My mom had longevity. There were some athletic genes that certainly got passed down.;Hale Irwin;dad
I miss my Dad. My Dad loved cheesy monster movies, so we'd have Godzilla movie marathons. Those are some of my favorite memories, laughing at how the monster outfits were so bad, like black garbage bags for heads.;Ahmet Zappa;dad
I've always had an affinity for lawyers. My dad is a lawyer. He's retired now. My brother is a lawyer.;Scott Bakula;dad
Every dad who loves his daughter is not going to want her to go with the penniless slacker loser poet bum, when she could go out with someone who's successful.;John Leguizamo;dad
My dad died when I was three so my mom had to raise four kids on her own, and I think there's a part of me that pulls upon having watched my mom do that our whole lives. She had to make it work.;Leslie Bibb;dad
Usually a family is led through the mom or the dad and their career and for the family to be led by my career, even though God has led it, could be a lot of pressure.;Stacie Orrico;dad
No one was more important than my mom and dad. I know they are watching from a place up in heaven here today to make sure all their kids are doing good.;Eddie Murray;dad
My dad recently reminded me that my grandfather's cousin was Lefty Frizzell.;Parker Posey;dad

My dad's an architect and my mom owned a French bakery for twelve years.;Alison Lohman;dad

I always told my dad I'd play professional football.;Anthony Doerr;dad
My dad doesn't like religion much, but I grew up very close to the Baptist tradition. God isn't this distant thing. God is right here with you all the time. He's your buddy, and you can talk about everything.;Lucy Alibar;dad
My dad was an inventor, and I think I've always had a rosy view of technology, or at least its potential.;Scott McCloud;dad
My dad, like many Southern men, is this very emotionally expressive person who isn't as articulate in words about his feelings as he is with breaking a chair or something like that.;Lucy Alibar;dad
My dad was an engineer and so I had this picture of science and technology and pursuits of the mind as being more impressive than artistic pursuits, which I saw a as kind of frivolous.;Scott McCloud;dad
I also turn down what's probably a good amount of coinage to be made out of playing dads, an incredible number of obnoxious dad.;Bill Pullman;dad
My mom and dad - they were always there. They were always on the set. They focused on our family life. The entertainment business wasn't the end-all. They weren't out to get the next big paycheck or the next big movie. It was about 'What can we do as a family.';Candace Cameron Bure;dad
I lost my mother, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease, and we had to relocate my dad after 58 years in the family home. That was tough.;Doug Davidson;dad
You know that family is going to be there for you no matter what. My dad gave me a freakin' kidney!;Sarah Hyland;dad
I have mostly been terrified of listening to scary stories around a campfire. We camp a lot as a family, and at night my dad would try and tell us scary stories. This made eating s'mores difficult. The story would start with something like... 'and the old man who lived in these woods...' I would then run back into the camper terrified.;Willow Shields;dad
Everyone gets surprised because neither one of my parents play golf. Like I said in my speech, my aunt and uncle really love golf, and we visited them, and she gave me two clubs. Like people think when they don't know who my dad is, they think he's my coach.;Lydia Ko;dad
My sensei was a British karate champion named Brian Fitkin. He was my mentor and because I had a hard relationship with my dad, he became a father figure to me.;Dolph Lundgren;dad
To me I'm just a regular person going to the mall with friends, and now I'm in Forever 21 and I see this random group of girls staring at me and taking pictures. But now I usually have my dad, who is a really tall and intimidating person with me, so he's kind of my bodyguard.;Rebecca Black;dad

I don't have a girlfriend. But I do know a woman who'd be mad at me for saying that.;Mitch Hedberg;dating

Real magic in relationships means an absence of judgment of others.;Wayne Dyer;dating
If there hadn't been women we'd still be squatting in a cave eating raw meat, because we made civilization in order to impress our girlfriends.;Orson Welles;dating
Nothing is perfect. Life is messy. Relationships are complex. Outcomes are uncertain. People are irrational.;Hugh Mackay;dating
I'm not the girl who always has a boyfriend. I'm the girl who rarely has a boyfriend.;Taylor Swift;dating
I like the bad-boy types. Generally the guy I'm attracted to is the guy in the club with all the tattoos and nail polish. He's usually the lead singer in a punk band and plays guitar. But my serious boyfriends are relatively clean-cut, nice guys. So it's strange.;Megan Fox;dating
There's only two people in your life you should lie to... the police and your girlfriend.;Jack Nicholson;dating
Smart women love smart men more than smart men love smart women.;Natalie Portman;dating
Assumptions are the termites of relationships.;Henry Winkler;dating
I'm quite sensitive to women. I saw how my sister got treated by boyfriends. I read this thing that said when you are in a relationship with a woman, imagine how you would feel if you were her father. That's been my approach, for the most part.;Orlando Bloom;dating
Nothing defines humans better than their willingness to do irrational things in the pursuit of phenomenally unlikely payoffs. This is the principle behind lotteries, dating, and religion.;Scott Adams;dating

Right now I'm pretty single... My career is my boyfriend.;Christina Aguilera;dating
You know, the man of my dreams might walk round the corner tomorrow. I'm older and wiser and I think I'd make a great girlfriend. I live in the realm of romantic possibility.;Stevie Nicks;dating
People could rationally decide that prolonged relationships take up too much time and effort and that they'd much rather do other kinds of things. But most people are afraid of rejection.;Albert Ellis;dating
You know when I feel inwardly beautiful? When I am with my girlfriends and we are having a 'goddess circle'.;Jennifer Aniston;dating
I am a hopeless romantic and I love to spoil my girlfriends.;Orlando Bloom;dating
I used to be a real prince charming if I went on a date with a girl. But then I'd get to where I was likely to have a stroke from the stress of keeping up my act. I've since learned the key to a good date is to pay attention on her.;Matthew Perry;dating
Well, a girlfriend once told me never to fight with anybody you don't love.;Jack Nicholson;dating
If you can lie, you can act, and if you can lie to crazy girlfriends, you can act under pressure.;Joe Rogan;dating
If you don't have a valentine, hang out with your girlfriends, don't go looking for someone. When it's right, they'll come to you.;Carmen Electra;dating
I don't know the first real thing about the dating game. I don't know how to talk to a specific person and connect. I just think you have to go to person by person and do the best you can with people in general.;Jason Schwartzman;dating
I'm 31 now. I think I'm beginning to understand what life is, what romance is, and what a relationship means.;Adam Sandler;dating
My boyfriend and I broke up. He wanted to get married and I didn't want him to.;Rita Rudner;dating

If you're a sports fan you realize that when you meet somebody, like a girlfriend, they kind of have to root for your team. They don't have a choice.;Jimmy Fallon;dating
I suppose I was a little bit of what would be called today a nerd. I didn't have girlfriends, and really I wasn't a very social boy.;Charles Kuralt;dating
I don't understand the whole dating thing. I know right off the bat if I'm interested in someone, and I don't want them to waste their money on me and take me out to eat if I know I'm not interested in that person.;Britney Spears;dating
Everything I buy is vintage and smells funny. Maybe that's why I don't have a boyfriend.;Lucy Liu;dating
Practically all the relationships I know are based on a foundation of lies and mutually accepted delusion.;Kim Cattrall;dating
Right now, I'm as single as a slice of American cheese.;Nick Cannon;dating
I've been dating since I was fifteen. I'm exhausted. Where is he?;Kristin Davis;dating

I was dating this guy and we would spend all day text messaging each other. And he thought that he could tell that he liked me more because he actually spelt the word 'YOU' and I just put the letter 'U'.;Kelly Osbourne;dating
Which is, I'm an optimist that two people can be together to work out their conflicts. And that commitment, I think, might be what love is, because they both grow from their relationship.;Garry Shandling;dating
I didn't have a financial need, and I wasn't very gifted at relationships. I probably was more like what we think of boys as being: hard to pin down and wary of commitment.;Candice Bergen;dating
My boyfriend calls me 'princess', but I think of myself more along the lines of 'monkey' and 'retard'.;Alicia Silverstone;dating
We are constantly protecting the male ego, and it's a disservice to men. If a man has any sensitivity or intelligence, he wants to get the straight scoop from his girlfriend.;Betty Dodson;dating
Thank God I never got in a fight. All of the jock dudes hated me, but all of their girlfriends thought I was nice so they wouldn't touch me. It was infuriating to them.;Mark Hoppus;dating
I have a lot of boyfriends, I want you to write that. Every country I visit, I have a different boyfriend. And I kiss them all.;Anna Kournikova;dating

My girlfriend bought me a down jacket, she said it fit my personality.;Jay London;dating

I think if I could have a boyfriend like my brothers I'd be really happy. But without the brother thing.;Patricia Velasquez;dating
At this year's Open, I'll have five boyfriends.;Anna Kournikova;dating
I fantasize about going back to high school with the knowledge I have now. I would shine. I would have a good time, I would have a girlfriend. I think that's where a lot of my pain comes from. I think I never had any teenage years to go back to.;Spalding Gray;dating

I started dating older men, and I would fall in love with them. I thought they could teach me about life.;Daphne Zuniga;dating
I think more dating stuff is scheduling. It's needing people who understand your work schedule.;Jennifer Love Hewitt;dating
It's weird, I never wish anything bad upon anybody, except two or three old girlfriends.;Carrot Top;dating
What I remember most about junior homecoming was my date getting sick afterwards. That kinda sucked. Then, senior year, someone got gum in her hair when we were dancing.

I stopped dating for six months a year ago. Dating requires a lot of energy and focus.;Daphne Zuniga;dating
Appearance is something you should definitely consider when you're going out. Have your girlfriend clip your nails or something like that.;Usher;dating
I'm not cynical about marriage or romance. I enjoyed being married. And although being single was fun for a while, there was always the risk of dating someone who'd owned a lunch box with my picture on it.;Shaun Cassidy;dating
The prospect of dating someone in her twenties becomes less appealing as you get older. At some point in your fife, your tolerance level goes down and you realize that, with someone much younger, there's nothing really to talk about.;Clint Eastwood;dating
Workshops and seminars are basically financial speed dating for clueless people.;Doug Coupland;dating
I prefer ordinary girls - you know, college students, waitresses, that sort of thing. Most of the girls I go out with are just good friends. Just because I go out to the cinema with a girl, it doesn't mean we are dating.;Leonardo DiCaprio;dating
My philosophy of dating is to just fart right away.;Jenny McCarthy;dating

Good-looking individuals are treated better than homely ones in virtually every social situation, from dating to trial by jury.;Martha Beck;dating

When I was first divorced, I started dating younger women, and it was really exciting. But after a while I was like, 'This is just dumb.';Louis C. K.;dating

I'm honest about the journey I've been on, so I definitely don't take dating lightly anymore.;Demi Lovato;dating
I can't imagine dating a boy, meeting him only outside the home. What's a home and family for if it's not the center of one's life?;Loretta Young;dating
When I started dating I had this kind of Romeo and Juliet, fateful romantic idea about love which was almost that you were a victim and there was a lot of pain involved and that was how it should be.;Emma Watson;dating
All my freakouts have been pretty private and directed at family pets and/or people I have been dating for too short a time to freak out at in that way.;Lena Dunham;dating

Well, dating has become a sport and not about finding the person you love.;Rashida Jones;dating
I'm friends with a lot of my exes, but it took time. We didn't just get into it. I don't think you can be friends until you're cool with them dating someone else. That's when you know.;Rashida Jones;dating
I'm not great at dating, but I need to do it to relax.;Lena Dunham;dating
Dating is just awkward moments and one person wants more than the other. It's just that constant strangeness. I think it's a very real thing.;Jason Schwartzman;dating
I give dating advice on a regular basis. It's not that I'm any expert, but it's always nice to share that with your friends.;Ashley Tisdale;dating
I don't really believe in rules, but I do like old-fashioned dating where you don't call the guy until he calls you. I don't think it's like he's got to do this and that's the rule.;Ashley Tisdale;dating

My mom is going to kill me for talking about sleeping with people. But I don't want to put myself in the position where I'm in a monogamous relationship right now. I'm not dating just one person.

I've had two romances since moving to Las Vegas. One was with somebody 12 years older than me, and the other was the same age, and neither worked out. I know people still think of me as one of Hugh Hefner's girlfriends, and he of course was much older than me, but that was a whole different lifestyle and a different kind of dating.;Holly Madison;dating
I have put gay dating on the map.;Patti Stanger;dating
I had to find a diet that would kick me back into dating shape, because I know that I can't date at size 8. I have to date at size 2. And it's just a fact of nature. Go get your injections and your chemical peels. You gotta look good to attract a man.;Patti Stanger;dating
Taylor Swift dates guys so she can write a breakup song about them. I don't think she's dating for love - I think she's dating for creativity. So let's get her off the market and put her in dating detox. If she really wants love, she has to stop writing music about them.;Patti Stanger;dating
The rich are different. Their wants are very high maintenance. They'll pick eye color and hair color, all the way down to what she does for a living, what school she went to. Their list can be extremely long. But at the end of the day, dating is dating, because they're human beings.;Patti Stanger;dating

After a number of years dating, we decided we were good partners.;Melinda Gates;dating
I always hated high-school shows and high-school movies, because they were always about the cool kids. It was always about dating and sex, and all the popular kids, and the good-looking kids. And the nerds were super-nerdy cartoons, with tape on their glasses. I never saw 'my people' portrayed accurately.;Paul Feig;dating
Dating is really hard because everyone puts on a front. It's really difficult to see who is who, so it is important to be yourself.;Brooke Burke;dating

If I'm with a man, is that going to prevent me from achieving my goal? What sacrifices will I have to make in terms of being myself, if I'm with a man? Something that young women find out really quickly is that when you start dating, all of a sudden you're supposed to have a role. You're not allowed to just be yourself.;Candace Bushnell;dating
Evolution is unobservable. It's based on blind faith in a few dry bones and on unreliable dating systems in which the gullible trust. Kids should be allowed to make up their own minds about this issue, and not be censored to 'one side is all we will let you hear.';Ray Comfort;dating
I ain't scared to do another dating show, but I ain't really trying to. I want to do a talk show or something. I've done enough dating on television. I'm ready to spread my wings, and go down other avenues.;Flavor Flav;dating
Like many of you, I've always been slightly obsessed with vampires, dating back to the prime-time series 'Dark Shadows,' which I followed avidly as a kid.;Bill Condon;dating
I like the idea of dating, but I'm not dating anyone exclusively, particularly right now. It's hard to be in a relationship unless you're ready to go public with it.

I wish I was dating one of the ladies in 'Bollywood Hero.' They're gorgeous. Any of them.;Chris Kattan;dating
I'm finally dating. It's fun.;Kristin Chenoweth;dating

I'm very open to dating and finding a guy.;Kristin Cavallari;dating

I don't have dating tips.;Bill Keller;dating
I have no wisdom to share on dating.;Rachel Dratch;dating

Celebrities say they date other celebrities because they have the same job. But I think they just like dating famous people. Celebrities attract each other, like cattle.;Jason Lee;dating

Here's the funny thing about the response I've been aware of to my dating famous people: It's been very negative. I'm either not good-looking enough, not a good enough actor or not successful enough for these people.;Dax Shepard;dating
It's ironic, really. Guys should be excited that I got Kristen Bell. If Brad Pitt gets Kristen Bell, it's like, 'Well, of course he did.' With me, it should be, 'Oh good, a normal-looking guy got her. Maybe I'll get me a Kristen Bell.' But guys hate my guts for always dating women I have no right to be with.;Dax Shepard;dating
Stuff about me dating Kim Kardashian - I have no idea where that came from and all these other rumors. I don't think I'm that type.;Jeremy Lin;dating
I think feminism's a bit misinterpreted. It was about casting off all gender roles. There's nothing wrong with a man holding a door open for a girl. But we sort of threw away all the rules, so everybody's confused. And dating becomes a sloppy, uncomfortable, unpleasant thing.;Zosia Mamet;dating
The woman I am currently crazy about was a vegetarian for a year until I started dating her. As is the case with most vegetarians, she had never eaten properly prepared meat, only commercially packaged or otherwise abused flesh.;Steve Albini;dating
I don't mind dating younger men now.;Jackee Harry;dating

I'm opening up my heart to the idea of dating. It's funny - my friends would always come to me for romantic advice. I know nothing, and things have changed since I was dating in high school! I'm really trying hard to spend this time working on myself.;Olivia Wilde;dating
I heard on public radio recently, there's a thing called Weed Dating. Singles get together in a garden and weed and then they take turns, they keep matching up with other people. Two people will weed down one row and switch over with two other people. It's in Vermont. I don't think I'd be very good at Weed Dating.;Roy Blount, Jr.;dating
It was funny actually because that was still during the time we were dating. He would get all these calls because supposedly before we broke up, we had already broken up in the trades, in the rags or whatever.;Rosario Dawson;dating
I've been in plenty of situations where someone I'm dating had more time for a console than me.;Josie Maran;dating

I am dating, but it is hard to find someone quick enough and funny enough. I am quite demanding.;Anne Robinson;dating
Years later I would hear my father say the divorce had left him dating his children. That still meant picking us up every Sunday for a matinee and, if he had the money, an early dinner somewhere.;Andre Dubus III;dating
In my own relationships, I know that I should break up with someone who doesn't encourage me to be strong and make my own choices and do what's best in my life, so if you're dating someone who doesn't want you to be the best person you can be, you shouldn't be dating them.;Veronica Roth;dating
I'm a fan of horrors. I love the ones that make you jump. My girlfriend hates it. I've been dating her for one-and-a-half years and I'm crazy about her, but she's terrified of horror films. Not the cute 'Will you hold me?' way, but she's weeping. With 'House of Wax,' we'll be sleeping and I'll go to the bathroom and she's sitting up waiting for me.;Jared Padalecki;dating
Yeah, I think everybody has the crises of questioning themselves at some point or other in their lives. Is this where I should live? The job I should have? The girl I should be dating? Is this the friend I should have?;Chris Messina;dating
I feel like I am a real artist and I want to be able to feel what I am singing about. So when I sing, 'Leave (Get Out),' I have been through that. I think it is just a new generation, whether people are ready for it or not. Teenagers are dating.;JoJo;dating
Dating and getting attention from boys was something that came later to me.;Rachelle Lefevre;dating

I don't talk about who I'm dating because when you break up, you wind up reliving it in the media.;Bridget Fonda;dating

I don't really talk about my personal life. It's a strange and funny and weird thing. Sometimes you have a conversation with someone and the paparazzi snaps a picture of you and people decide you're dating. If I try to answer everything people say, I would be up all night.;Tracee Ellis Ross;dating
I was dating a guy that was a huge wrestling fan and I'm embarrassed to say it now but I used to make fun of him for watching it.;Torrie Wilson;dating

Sinful and forbidden pleasures are like poisoned bread they may satisfy appetite for the moment, but there is death in them at the end.;Tryon Edwards;death

If you make every game a life and death proposition, you're going to have problems. For one thing, you'll be dead a lot.;Dean Smith;death

To a billion people around the world surviving on just a dollar a day, the question of what to eat tonight is more about life and death than about recipes.

But the issue is not only life and death but our existence before God and our being judged by him. All of us were sinners before him and worthy of condemnation.;Hans Urs von Balthasar;death
There's really no such thing as the agony of dying. I'm quite sure that pain is shut off at the moment of death. You see, something happens when the body knows it's about to go. Peptide hormones are released by cells in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. Endorphins. They attach themselves to the cells responsible for feeling pain.;Lewis Thomas;death
A lot of people fear death because they think that so overwhelming an experience has to be painful, but I've seen quite a few deaths, and, with one exception, I've never known anyone to undergo anything like agony.

Liberty for wolves is death to the lambs.;Isaiah Berlin;death
I think one thing that kids who grow up on farms really have going for them is they have exposure to death and birth in a totally different way. I think it takes away a little bit of the mystery and a little bit of the fear, and I do wish I had that. And I wish I was able to grow my own food.;Rachel McAdams;death
I now bid farewell to the country of my birth - of my passions - of my death a country whose misfortunes have invoked my sympathies - whose factions I sought to quell - whose intelligence I prompted to a lofty aim - whose freedom has been my fatal dream.;Thomas Francis Meagher;death

We see death constantly on film.;Michael Sheen;death
For a culture that has such a problem with death, we seem to deal with it in a quite bizarre way. We see people shot, killed and blown up, and we find it funny and sexy and all those things. But, the reality of it is that every day people die, and people are really sad and they grieve and they go through a really difficult process with it.;Michael Sheen;death
'Hamlet' is one of the most dangerous things ever set down on paper.

If a lot of people gripped a knife and fork the way they do a golf club, they'd starve to death.;Sam Snead;death
In almost every interview someone asks what does HIM stand for. I can't even remember our latest lie about that. When Hanson was hot, we said it means Hanson Is Murder.

Early this morning, I signed my death warrant.;Michael Collins;death

In an artwork you're always looking for artistic decisions, so an ashtray is perfect. An ashtray has got life and death.;Damien Hirst;death

The difference between art about death and actual death is that one's a celebration and the other's a dull fact.;Damien Hirst;death
I was taught to confront things you can't avoid. Death is one of those things.

I wouldn't feel satisfied being on set every day doing a romantic comedy - I'd be bored to death.;Joaquin Phoenix;death
It's not life or death it's a game and at the end of the game there is going to be a winner and a loser.;Bernhard Langer;death

I think that obviously, there is a perverse attraction to a fundamentally changed world or the end of the world. There is a death wish, a perverse death wish. Not just for ourselves, not just for the movie 'Death Wish,' but for the end of all human life.;John Hodgman;death
When you think about it, the end of the world is a little bit like death: We all know it's going to come eventually, and as we get older, we feel we see the signs more and more distinctly.;John Hodgman;death

Death's an old joke, but each individual encounters it anew.;Ivan Turgenev;death

No real English gentleman, in his secret soul, was ever sorry for the death of a political economist.;Walter Bagehot;death
There are hundreds of Frank Lloyd Wright buildings around the United States and in other countries, too. Wright lived into his 90s, and one of his most famous buildings, the Guggenheim Museum in New York, was completed just before his death. Wright buildings look like Wright buildings - that is their paradox.;Jane Smiley;death

Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service.

The design of the Mac wasn't what it looked like, although that was part of it. Primarily, it was how it worked. To design something really well, you have to get it.

Designing is my hobby. If I didn't do what I do for a living - at some point when I don't do this for a living - I'll probably just do design work. I love finding really special pieces of furniture.;Ellen DeGeneres;design

While a case can be made for intelligent design, I can't figure out why some Christians are so thrilled about that possibility. First of all, it doesn't prove there's a God.

Now I design what I want to wear, and it works that way.;Alexander McQueen;design

Design is important, it's an important dimension in the car. It's not the only one.;Carlos Ghosn;design
Music is where I have the most creative freedom, but I love producing. To me, that's kind of where all the action is. You get a chance to have your hands in every aspect of a film.

A person should design the way he makes a living around how he wishes to make a life.;Charlie Byrd;design

It would have been difficult to design a path out of communism worse than the one that has been followed.;Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn;design
Can you design a Rorschach test that's going to make everyone feel something every time - and that looks like a Rorschach test? It's easy to show a picture of a kitten or a car accident.

When I design and wonder what the point is, I think of someone having a bad time in their life. Maybe they are sad and they wake up and put on something I have made and it makes them feel just a bit better. So, in that sense, fashion is a little help in the life of a person. But only a little.;Miuccia Prada;design
I mean, I think about it, but I don't design my record to get a certain public response.;Liz Phair;design

I've wanted to design golf courses ever since I was a kid. I suppose it comes from the way I've played the game. To find the proper way to play any hole, I've always begun by asking myself what the architect has tried to do with it.;Jack Nicklaus;design
A Nicklaus Design golf course is done by the guys in my company that I work with, that have been trained in my vision, and they do what they think I might do. They might come in the office and ask me questions and I'd certainly answer their questions, but I'm not involved in the site visits or anything else.;Jack Nicklaus;design

I've always been a bit of a decorator. I think if I wasn't a singer I'd probably be in stage setting or interior design or something. I like clutter and I'm quite visually greedy. I can't have things to be plain I have to have things looking interesting... maybe I'm just a frustrated interior designer stuck in a singing career.;Florence Welch;design

I learn my lines while on the golf course. I try to do two or three things at once. I have ideas for books all the time, I have ideas for paintings all the time, and I write them all down. I take my sketchpad and my iPad, which I design on, and I do sit down and do specific tasks at specific times.;Jane Seymour;design
The wisdom of crowds works when the crowd is choosing the price of an ox, when there's a single numeric average.

I write the way you might arrange flowers. Not every try works, but each one launches another. Every constraint, even dullness, frees up a new design.;Richard Powers;design
There are two kinds of designers: ones who are very happy locked in their office surrounded by their coterie. The last thing they need to do is to go to a trunk show they'd go running for the hills. I not only enjoy it, I think, how do you design things that are applicable to life - unless you live it?;Michael Kors;design
People kind of tend to mystify design and architecture by suggesting you need to train.;Marc Newson;design

I think it is really important to have a sense of business. As a designer you can get so wrapped up in the design and fashion side that you forget the business side.;Tommy Hilfiger;design
Websites are kind of useless. There's so much great web content and design out there, but the ways in which they are being experienced are not being maximized.;Dhani Harrison;design
If you were the first person ever to design an application for the iPhone and you patented it, you would be very, very better off than we are right now, you know? But you've got to be the first one to do it. So I figured that Led Zeppelin or the Stones were going to do it unless we just got on to it. So I got cracking with the guys from Apple.;Dhani Harrison;design
After working with clothes for so long, it seemed right to design them.;L'Wren Scott;design
The reward is that you can actually create a world separate from reality with a story, actors, music, and camera design. When it works it can entertain, move people and teach us all.;Colleen Atwood;design

We are not inferring design to account for a black box, but to account for an open box.;Michael Behe;design
It's about the power of design and the power of the human spirit. It's above paying anybody to do something stupid for money like reality television does - like ambushing people.;Genevieve Gorder;design
I think taking design out of the studio and really having a relationship with the people that you're making it for really convinced me of how powerful a thing design is. It's not just an aesthetic decoration.;Genevieve Gorder;design
One of the best animated films I've seen come out of Disney was the Tarzan movie. I wasn't crazy about the story or the design on Tarzan's face, but the traditional animation was spectacular.;Ralph Bakshi;design
I was in college, and very disappointed. I majored in commercial art and interior design for three or four years. At that time, it seemed the thing I really wanted to do, production design, just wasn't available in the U.K., so I turned to music.;Eric Burdon;design
I like to think that the Internet and file sharing, if utilized properly and embraced, and I emphasize properly, is a high-powered marketing design.;Seal;design

And then, build a bustling wonderful city of the 21st century, with a restoration of a spectacular skyline, which Manhattan, of course, needs. So, that is really the design as a whole.;Daniel Libeskind;design
For me, if I can design beautiful things that have the price be lower, I am thrilled.;Tory Burch;design
You can design a mortgage system that is different without a Fannie and Freddie, but there are principles you have to have, to have a good system.;Jamie Dimon;design
Traditional horizontal search engines cannot always identify the target audience, niche or vertical industry of a page or site. Vertical search engines address this issue by the nature of their design. They identify sites according to more specific criteria and sometimes even by human input.;Marc Ostrofsky;design
Even as a young boy, my passion was to design, and I have been very lucky to be able to do what I have loved all my life. There can be few greater gifts than that.;Valentino Garavani;design
I like the personality of the Belgians. They're deeply eccentric, which is something that comes across in their design - terrific.;Miranda Richardson;design

I think gardens are fantastic, and I'd love to draw and design and stuff like that. I love just planting flowers during the summer. There's something very humble about it, and natural and beautiful.;Ed Westwick;design

That's a hobby of mine - to do whatever I can for unusual for-hire creative projects. I am waiting for someone to really challenge me - obviously I'm often approached to do film related work, but I would be very happy to design a bar or an amusement park ride. I would love to be an imagineer!;Roman Coppola;design
I do love DVD and I've always taken them seriously. You know, on the Austin things, we really put a ton of work into them because there's so much design involved. And in this one, we thought a lot about it and what could go in.;Jay Roach;design
My biggest role as director on the film is keeping a sense of the overview - how to cast the movie and shoot it in such a way that it will cut together. And how to design the style and tone.;Jay Roach;design
Through no divine design or cosmic plan, we have inherited the mantle of life's caretaker on the earth, the only home we have ever known.;Michael Shermer;design
No architect troubled to design houses that suited people who were to live in them, because that would have meant building a whole range of different houses. It was far cheaper and, above all, timesaving to make them identical.;Michael Ende;design
I've generally got a good eye for design and proportion.;Bruce Oldfield;design
The demise of Google Reader, if logical, is a reminder of how far we've come from the cuddly old 'I'm Feeling Lucky' Google days, in which there was a foreseeably-astonishing delight in the way Google's evolving design tricks anticipated what users would like.;James Fallows;design

In two days, it's hard to to get the quality you would normally want for a design project.;Douglas Wilson;design

Throughout the country, I see the same design problems and solutions over and over.;Douglas Wilson;design
I gave the couple a hint of a design that would work great with the bones of their home. They weren't ready for it, and they embarrassed themselves and that's too bad.;Douglas Wilson;design
Being in the design industry, I've tended to meet more people who are affected by HIV and AIDS.;Douglas Wilson;design

Longhorns are unique - each and every one of them is a different color with a different design.;Janine Turner;design

I discovered at an early age that all I've ever wanted to do is design.;Jonathan Ive;design
Perhaps I'd like to design cars, but I don't think I'd be much good at it.;Jonathan Ive;design
If you're talking to an architect, he can look at a blank piece of paper, and once the initial design is there, the formula kicks in. Each room should have something unique and different about it - much the same way that in a song, every eight bars or so, a new piece of information should be introduced.;Ryan Tedder;design
Computers are scary. They're nightmares to fix, lose our stuff, and, on occasion, they crash, producing the blue screen of death. Steve Jobs knew this. He knew that computers were bulky and hernia-inducing and Darth Vader black. He understood the value of declarative design.;Wesley Morris;design
It was something I was more interested in myself. When I went to see my sister dance at ballet, I was really into costumes and the arts, and my family was also supportive of whatever me and my sister wanted to do. I would say I pushed myself the most to be into design.;Christian Siriano;design
So I went for engineering, specifically product design, which I enjoyed.;Debi Thomas;design
When I started this project, I was a young architect. I was very apprehensive about any changes to the design.

But it's a leap of faith that I didn't want to make initially - to put it mildly.;Michael Arad;design
For two years nobody talked about anything other than the name arrangement. There was no fund-raising and no progress being made on construction and design.;Michael Arad;design
How do you design it so that people can form a space of their own, and feel quiet and contemplative?;Michael Arad;design

I used to design for my body, which was flat-chested with big hips. That's why my clothes were tight on top with full skirts.;Betsey Johnson;design
We have no general conceptual thrust for the band, other than trying to make music that keeps our interest. When things are novel, they are probably things we have discovered by accident or investigation rather than by design.;Steve Albini;design
Initially, it was the unpractical in fashion that brought me to design my own line. I felt that it was much more attractive to cut clothes with respect for the living, three-dimensional body rather than to cover the body with decorative ideas.;Jil Sander;design
I think there is always a need for pure design. With pure design, you don't need so much decoration.;Jil Sander;design
It may sound ambitious, but I really hope that modern design will spread all around the globe.;Jil Sander;design
Everyone by now presumably knows about the danger of premature optimization. I think we should be just as worried about premature design - designing too early what a program should do.;Paul Graham;design
I had been impressed by the fact that biological systems were based on molecular machines and that we were learning to design and build these sorts of things.;K. Eric Drexler;design

Wherever there is a design that is highly successful in a broad range of similar environments, it is apt to emerge again and again, independently - the phenomenon known in biology as convergent evolution. I call these designs 'good tricks.';Daniel Dennett;design
There is a group of individuals who are radical jihadists. We need to call them by name. They believe it is OK to kill people in the name of their religion. It is not all of Islam. It is not all Muslims. But there is a subgroup who believe it is OK. In fact, it is their plan and design to kill people.;Tim Pawlenty;design
And I think my sexuality was heavily repressed by the church, by the, you know, the design of the mortal sins.;Thomas Keneally;design
So much of it is the design of the shot or the motion of the character it's the work you do so that it has the same things that are in the movie. In just a few frames it's got to communicate something clearly and dramatically.;Dennis Muren;design
Unfortunately, the client that exists today is still pretty much the prototype design.;Shawn Fanning;design
English is taking over the world. I just wrote a piece about it. And it's not by design. The United States dominates because it's the biggest market.;Norman Spinrad;design
My training as an engineer has enabled me to design the stuff, but the reason I do it is not to make music but for the opportunity to work with musicians.;Robert Moog;design
The point is that I don't design stuff for myself. I'm a toolmaker. I design things that other people want to use.;Robert Moog;design
Leon Theremin's original designs are elegant, ingenious and effective. As electronics goes, the theremin is very simple. But there are so many subtleties hidden in the details of the design. It's like a great sonnet, or a painting, or a speech, that is perfectly done on more than one level.;Robert Moog;design
We used to be referred to as bakers and then we became known as cake decorators and now we are known as cake designers. I teach at the French Culinary Institute in New York and cake design is a legitimate profession.;Ron Ben-Israel;design
It was by design that we mostly used pictures that you could not necessarily see what was going on, and that didn't really focus in on the band, but instead focused in on a theme.;Mike McCready;design
There is not necessarily a good reason why a regulator should have to be involved in product design and marketing for rich and sophisticated investors. We recommend that such investors should be able to sign a piece of paper, which allows them to go ahead and buy unregulated products at their own risk.;John Redwood;design
Last year, Congress gave the Department of Defense the authority to design a new civilian personnel system for its employees as part of the defense authorization bill.;Norm Dicks;design
I design some of my own clothes now.;Kiernan Shipka;design

Biological engineering is not necessarily understanding systems but rather, I want to be able to design and build biological systems to perform particular applications.;Drew Endy;design
It is to be noted that when any part of this paper appears dull there is a design in it.;Richard Steele;design
Once I got out of architecture school I decided not to be an architect, I just started my own little design studio.;Joseph Kosinski;design
I don't set goals. Like, that's what I want to be doing however many years from now. I do what I love to do at the moment. If I wake up tomorrow and decide I want to dance, that's what I'd do. Or design clothes.;Ayumi Hamasaki;design
And just when we were at the end of our design process there was the news that the Italian government and the U.S. government had signed an agreement to fly the first Italian astronaut on that flight.;Umberto Guidoni;design
I do what I love to do at the moment. If I wake up tomorrow and decide I want to dance, that's what I'd do. Or design clothes. I think I'd throw myself into whatever I'm doing now. It's not about abandoning what I was doing before, or giving up. It's about knowing that if I die tomorrow, I lived the way I wanted to.;Ayumi Hamasaki;design
Even private persons in due season, with discretion and temper, may reprove others, whom they observe to commit sin, or follow bad courses, out of charitable design, and with hope to reclaim them.;Isaac Barrow;design
In both business and personal life, I've always found that travel inspires me more than anything else I do. Evidence of the languages, cultures, scenery, food, and design sensibilities that I discover all over the world can be found in every piece of my jewelry.;Ivanka Trump;design
It is very important to lead the field and innovate in game design.;John Romero;design
You have to design and program differently. Combat action in an MMO is so different to combat in a first-person shooter.;John Romero;design
Good design is making something intelligible and memorable. Great design is making something memorable and meaningful.;Dieter Rams;design
By the fourth grade, I graduated to an erector set and spent many happy hours constructing devices of unknown purpose where the main design criterion was to maximize the number of moving parts and overall size.;Steven Chu;design
Golf course design is exciting.;Tom Kite;design
I'm really not for famous people who design a line for a company, when you know it's not really them creating it but a team of designers, especially when there are so many talented people who've taken the time to go and study fashion.;Bonnie Wright;design
Well, yes, I mean, I think that, you know, my sources suggest that there's a lot of support for the notion that there is a lot of Koran abuse and that it was very much a systematic design, not just an aberration.;Jane Mayer;design
I love graphic design. I love working with design, and I love storytelling, so I've been working on a children's book for a while, and I'd like to see that through.;Colleen Haskell;design
The roundness of life's design may be a sign that there is a presence beyond ourselves.;Wally Lamb;design
We opened a design center in the South of England last year as part of our strategy for being close to our customers and developing innovative products for exciting new markets.;David Milne;design
Dubstep has everything for me. Rhythm, sound design, heartfelt emotion - all in one place.;James Blake;design
In any case, his judgment and set of values, acting alone or through his assistants, determine not only what is gold and what is dross but the design of the history which he creates out of the metal. The historian decides what is significant, and what is not.;Samuel E. Morison;design
I don't design cars. I'm not a designer. I know what I desire to be built, I know what the end result is, the horsepower, the competition we'll be working against - but I leave it to the people who work with me to put it all together. I don't do anything.;Caroll Shelby;design
I do two things. I design mobile computers and I study brains.;Jeff Hawkins;design
It is not that you do wrong by design, but that you should never do right by mistake.;Junius;design
But my point is that you design something in the end that precludes any unhealthy trading practices that are not going to serve your environmental or your economic objectives but now is not the time to do it.;John Anderson;design
I'm into designing houses and interior design. I like change. I like creating things out of nothing.;Chris Kirkpatrick;design
I've always loved interior design.;Genie Francis;design
Once you come up with a premise, you have to work out how it all happened. It's a bit like coming up with a spectacular roof design first. Before you can get it up there, you need to build a solid foundation and supporting structure.;Linwood Barclay;design
Nothing they design ever gets in the way of a work of art.;Robert Hughes;design
The design of those commissioners, frigates and warlike force is directed rather against Long Island and these your Honors' possessions, than to the imagined reform of New England.;Peter Stuyvesant;design

I believe consistency and orthogonality are tools of design, not the primary goal in design.;Yukihiro Matsumoto;design
Actually, I didn't make the claim that Ruby follows the principle of least surprise. Someone felt the design of Ruby follows that philosophy, so they started saying that. I didn't bring that up, actually.;Yukihiro Matsumoto;design
Acting isn't for me. I don't like being told what to do. I'm more interested in set design, more visually driven.;Sofia Coppola;design

Looking back, video game design seems a natural fit, although there was no such thing when I was growing up. I built a Tic-Tac-Toe playing machine in my teens which went up in smoke on the night it was scheduled to go to a science fair.;David Crane;design
My background is in hardware design. I found hardware work to be a welcome change from thousands of hours of programming and that led to the designs you mentioned.;David Crane;design
I wear a lot of different hats - from writer to producer and artist. We all do 5 or 6 jobs, everything from creating our own graphic design to actually recording and the whole bit.;William Bell;design
If you decide to design your own language, there are thousands of sort of amateur language designer pitfalls.;Guido van Rossum;design
I am interested in computers and technology, and art, photography, and design.;William Landay;design

You all know that each title in the Chronicles has a chess theme that's partly because of the overall design of the Chronicles themselves - the game of chess as an analogue of the game of life.;Dorothy Dunnett;design
If we don't have accurate information, if we are not able to tell difficult truth one to another, we will never be able to effectively design a policy for Iraq.;Jack Reed;design
Usually I design the lighting and when I have the physical set there, I'm not good at going out loosely and saying, 'Do you what you want, give it to the editor, and he'll figure it out.' I physically then walk on with the actors and I say, 'Let's walk until you guys feel the space works for you, and tell me when all that happens.';Tarsem Singh;design
The New Testament evinces its universal design in its very, style, which alone distinguishes it from all the literary productions of earlier and later times.;Philip Schaff;design

So much of design is context.;Steve Madden;design
I could design an $800 shoe line it's easy. You use the best materials and you can make beautiful shoes. It's easier than making great shoes for $90.;Steve Madden;design
My strengths as a businessman lie in the design and sale of women's shoes, and I have never been comfortable with complicated or technical legal or business documents.;Steve Madden;design
The Constitution remains brilliant in its overall design and sound with respect to the Bill of Rights and the separation of powers.

The Court is most vulnerable and comes nearest to illegitimacy when it deals with judge-made constitutional law having little or no cognizable roots in the language or design of the Constitution.;Byron White;design
Once the product's task is known, design the interface first then implement to the interface design.;Jef Raskin;design
I've come up through art school, through painting, through graphic design, through advertising, through TV commercials and music video. I've designed books, built billboards, matchbooks, corporate identities. I continuously paint, I've done conceptual art pictures.;Tony Kaye;design
If a course needs to be in great condition to be played effectively, then the design strategy is flawed.;Tom Watson;design

Intelligent design itself does not have any content.;George Gilder;design
The interesting thing is when we design and architect a server, we don't design it for Windows or Linux, we design it for both. We don't really care, as long as we're selling the one the customer wants.;Michael Dell;design
Being non-commercial is never an ambition. Movies come together at different points for fortuitous reasons. You do them as you get the opportunity, as opposed to doing them when you choose to or design to.;Ethan Coen;design
Design can change how you look at yourself.;Ty Pennington;design
When you design it, think how you would feel if you had to fly it! Safety first!;Donald Wills Douglas;design

Different people have different styles, but there is an opportunity as a director to be a writer in every moment, with every visual cue and every piece of production design. Everything is a decision, and everything can be obsessed over.;B. J. Novak;design
The scientific argument advanced for intelligent design at the Dover trial, those arguments collapsed, scientifically and intellectually.;Kenneth R. Miller;design
The argument for intelligent design basically depends on saying, 'You haven't answered every question with evolution,'... Well, guess what? Science can't answer every question.;Kenneth R. Miller;design
The new strategy is to teach intelligent design without calling it intelligent design.;Kenneth R. Miller;design
For many years, I have lived uncomfortably with the belief that most planning and architectural design suffers for lack of real and basic purpose. The ultimate purpose, it seems to me, must be the improvement of mankind.;James Rouse;design
The mind is like a richly woven tapestry in which the colors are distilled from the experiences of the senses, and the design drawn from the convolutions of the intellect.;Carson McCullers;design
It is most necessary to avoid rusticity in any way, whether in material, design, or execution.;George Edmund Street;design
Computers are to design as microwaves are to cooking.;Milton Glaser;design
I just bought a Mac to help me design the next Cray.;Seymoure Cray;design
I decided to go to school for advertising and graphic design. That was what I was gonna do but acting is that thing, it's like a splinter in your mind and you can't get rid of it.

Since having the babies, I realize that 90 percent of losing weight is my diet.;Mariah Carey;diet

Perhaps one of the most important things you can do for human beings is wean them off an animal-based diet. It hardens the arteries and runs up our health-care costs.

I tried the paleo diet, which is the caveman diet - lots of meat. And I tried the calorie restriction diet: The idea is that if you eat very, very little - if you're on the verge of starvation, you will live a very long time, whether or not you want to, of course.;A. J. Jacobs;diet

The buildings that I build very often have a dreamlike reality. I don't mean by that they have a fantasy quality at all, in fact quite the reverse. They contain in some degree the ingredients that give dreams their power... stuff that's very close to us.;Christopher Alexander;dreams

I part of this great nation because my grandfather was born here, in Cincinnati, Ohio. He took a horse, back in 1895, and ride it all the way down to Guanajuato, looking for his American dream.

I couldn't help but to think back to my classmates at Thomas Jefferson High School in San Antonio.

To me, what I love about the draft is first, you see the young men who are realizing their dreams that they've worked so hard for. That's a pretty cool thing.

I've accomplished a lot, but I still have more dreams that I want to achieve.;Joe Jonas;dreams

When women earn the money for the family, everyone in the family benefits. We also know that when women have an income, everyone wins because women dedicate 90% of the income to health, education, to food security, to the children, to the family, or to the community, so when women have an income, everybody wins.;Michelle Bachelet;education
One of the factors a country's economy depends on is human capital. If you don't provide women with adequate access to healthcare, education and employment, you lose at least half of your potential.

What's got me excited about the education space is the growth of the Internet over the next 10, 20, 30 years.;Reed Hastings;education

I believe that a child going without an education is a crime.;Kamala Harris;education
Each year, I say I'm going to go to school next year. It's inevitable that I'll end up getting my education.;Eliza Dushku;education

By climbing a steeper road, the value and appreciation Delaware State students took and continue to take from their education and their experiences is just as great, if not greater, than students attending ivy league schools.;Michael N. Castle;education
Delaware State began as a school bent on service - teaching education, social services and nursing.;Michael N. Castle;education
They were often the first students in their family to go to college and the very idea of higher education was still foreign to them. They had to make a conscious and often difficult decision to come to college.;Michael N. Castle;education
This is a value-added college education if I have heard one described. And what is the most remarkable about Delaware State University graduates - is they just keeping giving back.;Michael N. Castle;education
What we're doing now is we're saying that individual schools can spend the money on their own priorities, so that head teachers can decide what's truly important, because the big shift in approach on education that we're taking - which is different from what happened before - is that we trust teachers and we trust heads.;Michael Gove;education
Unfortunately, the real achievements of children on the ground became debased and devalued because Labor education secretaries sounded like Soviet commissars praising the tractor production figures when we know that those exams were not the rock-solid measures of achievement that children deserve.;Michael Gove;education

Education makes children less dependent upon others and opens doors to better jobs and career possibilities.;Solomon Ortiz;education
Education is the silver bullet to improve this Nation's standing worldwide... and our teachers know that.;Solomon Ortiz;education
I think that every child grows up with the ideas that what we are given, is our society.

Sometimes that questioning leads to something more.;Alice Englert;education
The very effect of the education they were given... was to make men think and, thinking, they became less and less satisfied with the miserable pays they received.;John Grierson;education
I have a greater goal - to empower young people through music education.;Ruben Studdard;education

I will continue my activities related to education in one way or another. I certainly would have at the top my agenda, with respect to education, the need to do much better with modern educational technology.;Major Owens;education
The American Dream is still alive out there, and hard work will get you there. You don't necessarily need to have an Ivy League education or to have millions of dollars startup money. It can be done with an idea, hard work and determination.;Bill Rancic;education
My parents are very hard working people who did everything they could for their children.

We had great faith that with patience, understanding, and education, that my family and I could be helpful in changing their minds and attitudes around.;Ryan White;education
There is no war on women. Women are doing well. But women are thoughtful.

We care about jobs and the economy and healthcare and education. We care about a lot of different things.;Nikki Haley;education
I knew from a young age that I wanted to be an actor. I never even thought about other careers.

Let them be reassured, it has never been one of our intentions to ban religion in society, but solely to protect the national education system from any conspicuous display of religious affiliation.;Jean-Pierre Raffarin;education

Education is a vacine for violence.;Edward James Olmos;education
Education is the key. But it's the kind of education that we teach that is the key. We don't have it.;Edward James Olmos;education

Law without education is a dead letter. With education the needed law follows without effort and, of course, with power to execute itself indeed, it seems to execute itself.;Rutherford B. Hayes;education
I am less disposed to think of a West Point education as requisite for this business than I was at first. Good sense and energy are the qualities required.;Rutherford B. Hayes;education

I think any time you have too much education in one certain field, that can sometimes play against you.;Amber Tamblyn;education

I'm completely repudiating the idea that government has to get out of the way.;Vince Cable;environmental
We need to accept the seemingly obvious fact that a toxic environment can make people sick and that no amount of medical intervention can protect us. The health care community must become a powerful political lobby for environmental policy and legislation.;Andrew Weil;environmental
The environmental crisis arises from a fundamental fault: our systems of production - in industry, agriculture, energy and transportation - essential as they are, make people sick and die.;Barry Commoner;environmental

I really believe in the environmental movement right now - it only takes a little effort to make a big difference.;Brooke Burke;environmental
Americans don't pay much attention to environmental issues, because they aren't sexy. I mean, cleaning up coal plants and reining in outlaw frackers is hugely important work, but it doesn't get anybody's pulse racing.;Jeff Goodell;environmental
Mark Ruffalo, aka the Incredible Hulk, is the natural gas industry's worst nightmare: a serious, committed activist who is determined to use his star power as a superhero in the hottest movie of the moment to draw attention the environmental and public health risks of fracking.;Jeff Goodell;environmental
Have we failed to slow global warming pollution in part because climate and environmental activists have been too polite and well behaved?;Jeff Goodell;environmental
In this country, the health concerns and the environmental concerns are as deep as in Europe. All the surveys show that. But here, we didn't have the cultural dimension. This is a fast-food culture.;Jeremy Rifkin;environmental
The position I took at the time was that we hadn't really examined any of the potential environmental consequences of introducing genetically modified organisms.;Jeremy Rifkin;environmental
The industrial processes in use today were developed at a time when no one had to consider what the environmental impact was. Who cared? But making ecological concerns matter to a company's bottom line will help it do the research and development that will reinvent everything we buy.;Daniel Goleman;environmental
The most important environmental issue is one that is rarely mentioned, and that is the lack of a conservation ethic in our culture.;Gaylord Nelson;environmental

Why should we not expect self-designated environmental leaders to practice what they preach?;David Frum;environmental
I'm a latecomer to the environmental issue, which for years seemed to me like an excuse for more government regulation. But I can see that in rich societies, voters are paying less attention to economic issues and more to issues of the spirit, including the environment.;David Frum;environmental

You cannot achieve environmental security and human development without addressing the basic issues of health and nutrition.;Gro Harlem Brundtland;environmental
I don't think it's too hippie to want to clean up the planet so you don't wind up dying of some kind of cancer when you're 45 years old. It enrages me that these big cancer-research organizations can't be bothered to man the front lines of environmental protest.;Jello Biafra;environmental

Hydrogen holds great promise to meet many of our future energy needs, and it addresses national security and our environmental concerns. Hydrogen is the simplest, most abundant element in the universe.;Dan Lipinski;environmental
By cutting critical domestic programs such as education, health, environmental protection, and veterans' services, this budget reveals misplaced priorities.;Dan Lipinski;environmental
There are nuclear weapons in China, Iran, Korea and Pakistan. It wouldn't take much to send a couple of warheads off on this planet somewhere that would cause a lot of environmental damage, then if you have got someone who wants to retaliate you have real problems.;Edward James Olmos;environmental
I'd say that animal rights and environmental issues have always been at the forefront of my mind.;Corey Feldman;environmental

In every case, the environmental hazards were made known only by independent scientists, who were often bitterly opposed by the corporations responsible for the hazards.;Barry Commoner;environmental
By adopting the control strategy, the nation's environmental program has created a built-in antagonism between environmental quality and economic growth.;Barry Commoner;environmental
Environmental quality was drastically improved while economic activity grew by the simple expedient of removing lead from gasoline - which prevented it from entering the environment.;Barry Commoner;environmental
The wave of new productive enterprises would provide opportunities to remedy the unjust distribution of environmental hazards among economic classes and racial and ethnic communities.;Barry Commoner;environmental
The environmental crisis is a global problem, and only global action will resolve it.;Barry Commoner;environmental

These days, most nature photographers are deeply committed to the environmental message.;Galen Rowell;environmental

Federal elections happen every two years in this country. Presidential elections every four years. And four years just isn't long enough to dismantle all the environmental laws we've got in this country.;Jared Diamond;environmental
New Zealand needs to balance its environmental responsibilities with its economic opportunities, because the risk is that if you don't do that - and you want to lead the world - then you might end up getting unintended consequences.;John Key;environmental
Our work on light bulbs wasn't an arbitrary mandate. We didn't just pick a standard out of the air, or look for a catchy sounding standard like 25 by 2025 not based in science or feasibility. Instead, we worked with both industry and environmental groups to come up with a standard that made sense and was doable.;Fred Upton;environmental
Without international participation, jobs and emissions will simply shift overseas to countries that require few, if any, environmental protections, harming the global environment as well as the U.S. economy.;Fred Upton;environmental

In the United States, the most important environmental indicator, particulate air pollution, has been cut by more than half since 1955, rivers and coastal waters have dramatically improved, and forests are increasing.;Bjorn Lomborg;environmental
I think an old style of addressing environmental problems is ebbing, but the rise of the so-called conservative, political movement in this country is not a trend towards the future but a reaction to this very broad shift that we are undergoing.;Paul Hawken;environmental
Environmental protection doesn't happen in a vacuum. You can't separate the impact on the environment from the impact on our families and communities.;Jim Clyburn;environmental
Like I said, I'm more worried long term about the environmental issues then the use of arms.;Hans Blix;environmental
The Body Shop Foundation is run by our staff and supports social activism and environmental activism. We don't tend to support big agencies.;Anita Roddick;environmental

More than ever before, there is a global understanding that long-term social, economic, and environmental development would be impossible without healthy families, communities, and countries.;Gro Harlem Brundtland;environmental
There's so many issues tied to the meat industry. I mean, social, environmental, humanitarian - all of them. I know that when I'm eating that I'm not hurting the planet, I'm not hurting other people on this planet, I'm not hurting animals... and I'm not hurting nature.;Maggie Q;environmental
We all recognize that in recent decades, many important achievements have helped create a cleaner, healthier environment, yet our national needs in environmental health are not being fully met.;Samuel Wilson;environmental

It's more fun to experience things when you don't know what's going to happen.;Louis C. K.;experience
Can advertising foist an inferior product on the consumer? Bitter experience has taught me that it cannot. On those rare occasions when I have advertised products which consumer tests have found inferior to other products in the same field, the results have been disastrous.;David Ogilvy;experience
In my experience, it is rarer to find a really happy person in a circle of millionaires than among vagabonds.;Thor Heyerdahl;experience
Sometimes when we weep in the movies we weep for ourselves or for a life unlived. Or we even go to the movies because we want to resist the emotion that's there in front of us. I think there is always a catharsis that I look for and that makes the movie experience worthwhile.;Edward Zwick;experience
There are such beings as vampires, some of us have evidence that they exist. Even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience, the teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane peoples.;Bram Stoker;experience
If you sit in a position where decisions that you take would have a serious effect on people, you can't ignore a lot of experience around the world which says this drug has these negative effects.;Thabo Mbeki;experience

The position that I take partly as a result of living in Asia is where you stop living according to your expectations and you become available to experience things as they are.;Martha Beck;experience

Everyone will experience the consequences of his own acts. If his act are right, he'll get good consequences if they're not, he'll suffer for it.;Harry Browne;experience
Going to the theater is such a joyous experience. My dad would take my sister and me to plays when we were very young, like six or seven years old.;Julia Roberts;experience
The soul is everlasting, and its learning experience is lifetime after lifetime.;Shirley MacLaine;experience
When a child comes in, I believe that it's a 'multipersonhood,' and it knows it, its consciousness knows it, and it has a nuclei in the center of its consciousness that is the repository of all experience and all knowledge. And when you look in the eyes of your baby and you feel this sense that they are an old soul, I believe indeed they are.;Shirley MacLaine;experience
Well, I think the main message is there is more to your story. There is more than what happens between the crib and the grave, and that is what I am really trying to speak to, this idea that all of life is this life and that there is nothing more than what we see and experience right here on this earth.;Max Lucado;experience
The biggest danger to the European Union comes not from those who advocate change, but from those who denounce new thinking as heresy. In its long history Europe has experience of heretics who turned out to have a point.;David Cameron;experience
I'm not trying to be romantic. I think you can tell when people are trying to be sexy onstage. When I was doing 'All the Way,' I was really thinking about my wife. People don't know my personal experience, but they can tell it's an honest interpretation.;Harry Connick, Jr.;experience
While teaching, I also worked undercover in the lower courts by saying I was a young law teacher wanting experience in criminal law. The judges were happy to assist me but what I learned was how corrupt the lower courts were. Judges were accepting money right in the courtroom.;Samuel Dash;experience
I believe there's no proverb but what is true they are all so many sentences and maxims drawn from experience, the universal mother of sciences.;Miguel de Cervantes;experience
Loneliness is and always has been the central and inevitable experience of every man.;Thomas Wolfe;experience
The deeper the experience of an absence of meaning - in other words, of absurdity - the more energetically meaning is sought.;Vaclav Havel;experience

I did a play called Throne of Straw when I was 11, at the Odyssey Theatre in Los Angeles. It became really clear to me at that point that I enjoyed acting more than any other experience I was having.;Kiefer Sutherland;experience
You can't leave out half the world's experience and expect to address all the problems. Women communicate differently and process information differently, which leads them to resolve conflicts differently.;Dee Dee Myers;experience
There's nothing wrong with acknowledging the panoply of life's rich experience.;David Duchovny;experience
When fish experience something that would cause other animals physical pain, they behave in ways suggestive of pain, and the change in behaviour may last several hours.;Peter Singer;experience

I am the the type to have a personal experience with a celebrity, but I'm too classy to bring that up.;Todd Barry;experience
I've always been attracted to cars, and driving is a completely measurable experience: if you qualify last on the grid, you're the slowest, and if you qualify first on the grid, you're the fastest. So no one can say you're slow if you're fast and no one can say you're fast if you're slow.;Eric Bana;experience
When I look back at the tapes, your first everything, your first All-Star Game, your first playoff experience, it just seems like it went by really fast.;Roger Clemens;experience

Whether born from experience or inherent physiological or cultural differences our gender and national origins may and will make a difference in our judging.;Sonia Sotomayor;experience
I very rarely came across rude or disrespectful people. I don't know how I slipped by all of them, but I honestly can't think of one experience off the top of my head that was like that. I'm sure they're there, but I'd have to think really hard to recall them.;Scott Baio;experience
Yet higher religion, which is only a search for a larger life, is essentially experience and recognized the necessity of experience as its foundation long before science learnt to do so.;Muhammad Iqbal;experience
It may, however, be said that the level of experience to which concepts are inapplicable cannot yield any knowledge of a universal character, for concepts alone are capable of being socialized.;Muhammad Iqbal;experience
The standpoint of the man who relies on religious experience for capturing Reality must always remain individual and incommunicable.;Muhammad Iqbal;experience
An enormous part of our mature experience cannot not be expressed in words.;Alfred North Whitehead;experience
When I was 12 years old, someone took me to see Martha Graham. It was nothing like what I thought of as serious dancing and even then I knew I was having a great experience. It was as if somebody was moving through space like no one ever did before.;Leslie Fiedler;experience
For some young people, their first experience ever hearing punk rock music was playing the Green Bay Packers on 'Madden'.;Billie Joe Armstrong;experience
I have a theory that the best ads come from personal experience. Some of the good ones I have done have really come out of the real experience of my life, and somehow this has come over as true and valid and persuasive.;David Ogilvy;experience
Many spiritual teachers - in Buddhism, in Islam - have talked about first-hand experience of the world as an important part of the path to wisdom, to enlightenment.;Bell Hooks;experience

More people should read books. It's the most concentrated experience you can have.;Vivienne Westwood;experience
The first essential in writing about anything is that the writer should have no experience of the matter.;Isadora Duncan;experience
I hate it when people don't recognize the work of women as being universal, or having any import to the world at large, as opposed to men's work, which is generally tends to be seen as more universal - men's writing about their own experience tends to be put in a broader context.;Ani DiFranco;experience
I had the experience last year of directing my first feature while I had a 1-year-old son and while I was also pregnant, so I am now well aware of the difficulties women who are rearing children face when they're also trying to make headway in mainstream of film.;Diablo Cody;experience
You know, it shouldn't just be about women as heroic figures overcoming things, it just needs to be about women in general getting the opportunity to play a multitude of roles, telling a multitude of stories - just to express human experience from a woman's perspective. I hope, someday, we can get to that point. I'm all about representation.;Diablo Cody;experience
There's probably no experience more alienating than fame, other than a terminal illness, where you actually find yourself in a situation that nobody around you can relate to.;Diablo Cody;experience
One nice thing about being a woman in Hollywood is that the women tend to be very close-knit. All of us writers and directors know each other and cling to each other for safety and support, and it's really a completely different vibe than the men experience out here, where they're all trying to murder each other.;Diablo Cody;experience
History and experience tell us that moral progress comes not in comfortable and complacent times, but out of trial and confusion.;Gerald R. Ford;experience
A woman's experience is different from a man's in virtually every respect, including how she is treated by the media.;Carly Fiorina;experience
I'd like to believe an accumulation of experience has made me a sort of a grown-up person, so I can have judgment and taste and whatever.;Maurice Sendak;experience
Being an actor means asking people to look at you. I guess I accept that. But it's a profession in which the job is to show another world and other people. You may access it through bits of yourself, and your imagination and experience, but actually, in the end, you're not playing yourself.;Ralph Fiennes;experience
I developed a mechanism so that whatever mistakes I made, I would bounce straight back. Whatever was happening off the pitch, I could put it to one side and maintain my form. Call it mental resilience or a strong mind, but that is what we mean when we talk about experience in a football team.;Gary Neville;experience
What if Barack Obama established a Presidential Advisory Committee that would meet once every couple of months, bringing together the former presidents for a conference in order to seek their collective wisdom?

Experience is what enables you to recognize a mistake when you make it again.;Earl Wilson;experience
A great many people experience the movement from one century to the next, but a minuscule number of people experience the movement from one millennium to the next.;Neale Donald Walsch;experience
I need more raw experience. I've read and watched a lot of things, but I haven't done a lot of things.;Marc Andreessen;experience

Progress is measured by richness and intensity of experience - by a wider and deeper apprehension of the significance and scope of human existence.;Herbert Read;experience
I had a heartbreaking experience when I was 9. I always wanted to be a guard. The most wonderful girl in the world was a guard. When I got polio and then went back to school, they made me a guard. A teacher took away my guard button.;Francis Ford Coppola;experience
I think how pay gets determined is pretty broad - experience, how people look, what they bring to the job. But there's no question women are paid less. Women don't ask.;Dee Dee Myers;experience
Something happens to us all when we experience something as a unit that doesn't occur when we're on our couches or holding our little portable DVD players.;David Ogden Stiers;experience
What we have to get clear to kids is that when you offer your stillness and open yourself to the experience of music, it pays you back more than you give.;David Ogden Stiers;experience

It is an axiom, enforced by all the experience of the ages, that they who rule industrially will rule politically.;Aneurin Bevan;experience

Food is our common ground, a universal experience.;James Beard;experience
When I was young, I was just about hard work. But as I got older, I did experience anxiety, doubt, judgment, and it's so easy to lose yourself for a second.;Jennifer Lopez;experience
The nature of the global business environment guarantees that no matter how hard we work to create a stable and healthy organisation, our organisation will continue to experience dramatic changes far beyond our control.;Margaret J. Wheatley;experience
What is the good of drawing conclusions from experience? I don't deny we sometimes draw the right conclusions, but don't we just as often draw the wrong ones?;Georg C. Lichtenberg;experience
Without in any way minimising the economic and psychological blow that people experience when they lose their jobs, the unemployed in affluent countries still have a safety net, in the form of social security payments, and usually free healthcare and free education for their children. They also have sanitation and safe drinking water.;Peter Singer;experience
Anyone who teaches knows that you don't really experience a text until you've taught it, in loving detail, with an intelligent and responsive class.;Joyce Carol Oates;experience
Men do weird things when they experience fear. It's like a fight-or-flight thing.;Rashida Jones;experience
In high school, I was on the youth advisory council for the Mayor's Office of Los Angeles, and that was kind of my first experience in the bureaucratic system. We tried to get things done, and nobody was really interested in getting anything done.;Rashida Jones;experience
If your faith is opposed to experience, to human learning and investigation, it is not worth the breath used in giving it expression.;E. W. Howe;experience
The most important American addition to the World Experience was the simple surprising fact of America. We have helped prepare mankind for all its later surprises.;Daniel J. Boorstin;experience
All observers not laboring under hallucinations of the senses are agreed, or can be made to agree, about facts of sensible experience, through evidence toward which the intellect is merely passive, and over which the individual will and character have no control.;Chauncey Wright;experience
Our science fails to recognize those special properties of life that make it fundamental to material reality. This view of the world - biocentrism - revolves around the way a subjective experience, which we call consciousness, relates to a physical process. It is a vast mystery and one that I have pursued my entire life.;Robert Lanza;experience
Our thoughts have an order, not of themselves, but because the mind generates the spatio-temporal relationships involved in every experience.;Robert Lanza;experience
Politics is the only field in which the more experience you have, the worse you get.;Kinky Friedman;experience
You don't cheat anybody out of their experience, whatever it is.;Andre Agassi;experience
Each of us brings to our job, whatever it is, our lifetime of experience and our values.;Sandra Day O'Connor;experience
You have to see a building to comprehend it. Photographs cannot convey the experience, nor film.;Arthur Erickson;experience
So I've seen life as one long learning process. And if I see - you know, if I fly on somebody else's airline and find the experience is not a pleasant one, which it wasn't in - 21 years ago, then I'd think, well, you know, maybe I can create the kind of airline that I'd like to fly on.;Richard Branson;experience
Without fullness of experience, length of days is nothing. When fullness of life has been achieved, shortness of days is nothing. That is perhaps why the young have usually so little fear of death they live by intensities that the elderly have forgotten.;Lewis Mumford;experience
I prefer to think of the audience as a single living organism with which I am sharing a singular, never-to-be-repeated experience.;Martha Plimpton;experience
I think in most jobs, you get better as you get older. You gain experience, you gain knowledge.;Kristin Scott Thomas;experience
Not what we experience, but how we perceive what we experience, determines our fate.;Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach;experience
Ordinary professionalism and 20 years' experience can accomplish a lot, but it can't access the hidden places.;Jeanette Winterson;experience
Art is the imposing of a pattern on experience, and our aesthetic enjoyment is recognition of the pattern.;Alfred North Whitehead;experience

There's a positive side to film and television, the sense of feeding into the theater... Your fans will follow you, hopefully, and be open-minded to see you play other things and experience other stories you want to tell.;Kim Cattrall;experience
The problem was to sustain at any cost the feeling you had in the theater that you were watching a real person, yes, but an intense condensation of his experience, not simply a realistic series of episodes.;Arthur Miller;experience
Have you noticed in your past experience that your kind interpretations were almost always truer than you harsh one?;Lawrence G. Lovasik;experience
Given that religious faith is an intrinsic element of human experience, it is best to approach and engage the subject with a sense of history and a critical sensibility.;Jon Meacham;experience
I can't control what people think. I'm not trying to manipulate people's thoughts or sentiments. I write all the time. You have to experience life, make observations, and ask questions. It's machine-like how things are run now in hip-hop, and my ambitions are different.;Mos Def;experience
If you're writing, you're starting in private. It can really be this amazing, private, freeing experience. Forget that it's for other people - that comes in later.;Lena Dunham;experience
Everybody's entitled to think whatever they want and to express that, but my personal day-to-day experience does not come into contact with any of those people.;Amy Grant;experience
Words are capable of making experience more vivid, and also of organizing it. They can scare us, and they can comfort us.;Jonathan Safran Foer;experience
I think on-stage nudity is disgusting, shameful and damaging to all things American. But if I were 22 with a great body, it would be artistic, tasteful, patriotic and a progressive religious experience.;Shelley Winters;experience
So that ends my first experience of matrimony, which I always thought a highly over-rated performance.;Isadora Duncan;experience
With 'Good Will Hunting,' Miramax made certain the recruited audience wasn't expecting to laugh at Robin Williams like they normally do. From my limited experience, you can really blow test screenings by conducting them in the wrong way.;Gus Van Sant;experience
There can be no knowledge without emotion. We may be aware of a truth, yet until we have felt its force, it is not ours. To the cognition of the brain must be added the experience of the soul.;Arnold Bennett;experience
I have never found, in a long experience of politics, that criticism is ever inhibited by ignorance.;Harold MacMillan;experience
In long experience I find that a man who trusts nobody is apt to be the kind of man nobody trusts.;Harold MacMillan;experience
I had a lot of experience with people smarter than I am.;Gerald R. Ford;experience

I just think that the collective experience of going to see a film is something you can't recreate.;Daniel Craig;experience
There's a vintage which comes with age and experience.;Jon Bon Jovi;experience
I discovered early on that some performers live their life in order to act, so all their relationships are simply an experience that they can feed back into their work. Which I find vampiric.;Cate Blanchett;experience
At every step the child should be allowed to meet the real experience of life the thorns should never be plucked from his roses.;Ellen Key;experience
There is no wider gulf in the universe than yawns between those on the hither and thither side of vital experience.;Rebecca West;experience
I do write a lot from personal experience, but I also embellish a bit.;Miranda Lambert;experience
And we're seeing a higher level of consciousness and many more opportunities for people to challenge their present ways of thinking and move into a grander and larger experience of who they really are.;Neale Donald Walsch;experience
If we're picking people to draw out of their own conscience and experience a 'new' Constitution, we should not look principally for good lawyers. We should look to people who agree with us. When we are in that mode, you realize we have rendered the Constitution useless.;Antonin Scalia;experience
It lies in human nature that where you experience your first laughs, you also remember the age kindly.;Vaclav Havel;experience
The experience of being in space didn't change my perspective of myself or of the planet or of life. I had no spiritual experience.;Sally Ride;experience
You know, young actors say all the time, 'Should I use my own life experience?' And my response is, 'What choice do you have?';David Mamet;experience
Find what's hot, find what's just opened and then look for the worst review of the week. There is so much to learn from watching a restaurant getting absolutely panned and having a bad experience. Go and see it for yourself.;Gordon Ramsay;experience
If you've got a piece and you can feel the person who's going to direct it is really made for it, if it's really special for them, then it's going to be a better-than-usual experience.;Edward Norton;experience
In my books, I never portray violence as a reasonable solution to a problem. If the lead characters in the story are driven to it, it's at the extreme end of their experience.;Dean Koontz;experience
You know, in 1975 I couldn't get a job in New York City because I was American. The kitchens were predominantly run by French, Swiss, German, and basically I got laughed at. I had education, I had experience, but got laughed at because I was American.;Emeril Lagasse;experience
Music is subjective to everyone's unique experience.;Jared Leto;experience
The aim of all commentary on art now should be to make works of art - and, by analogy, our own experience - more, rather than less, real to us. The function of criticism should be to show how it is what it is, even that it is what it is, rather than to show what it means.;Susan Sontag;experience
The experience and behavior that gets labeled schizophrenic is a special strategy that a person invents in order to live in an unlivable situation.;R. D. Laing;experience
Some writers can only deal with childhood experience, because it's complete. For another kind of writer, life goes on, and he's able to keep processing that as well.;V. S. Naipaul;experience
There are people hell-bent on the idea that we're a Christian band in disguise, and that we have some secret message. We have no spiritual affiliation with this music. It's simply about life experience.;Amy Lee;experience
If a movie is really working, you forget for two hours your Social Security number and where your car is parked. You are having a vicarious experience. You are identifying, in one way or another, with the people on the screen.;Roger Ebert;experience
Love is blind. My politics has been, too. I think you can fall in love with ideas, and you can fall in love with people. It's a very subjective experience. And I'm loyal to that experience.;Robert Wyatt;experience
Experience isn't interesting until it begins to repeat itself. In fact, till it does that, it hardly is experience.;Elizabeth Bowen;experience
I always thought that one of the reasons why a painter likes especially to have other painters look at his or her work is the shared experience of having pushed paint around.;Chuck Close;experience
Joy, rather than happiness, is the goal of life, for joy is the emotion which accompanies our fulfilling our natures as human beings. It is based on the experience of one's identity as a being of worth and dignity.;Rollo May;experience
I remember when I was 33 or 34, it was devastating because I realized I wasn't a kid anymore. The great thing about 40 was that I really felt like I had life experience and knew what I was doing now.;Jennifer Lopez;experience
Where you are in consciousness has everything to do with what you see in experience.;Eric Butterworth;experience
Obviously an actor draws on his own experience.;Christopher Walken;experience

To be in a situation where you have no rights whatsoever is something I wish everybody could experience. People's attitudes would change. It would be a better place.;Tommy Chong;experience
I always try to keep the circumstances in my life fresh. I like to change the physical environment I live in, change the people around me and try to experience things for the first time. I think that keeps one on their toes, creatively and spiritually.;Lenny Kravitz;experience
The science of politics is the one science that is deposited by the streams of history, like the grains of gold in the sand of a river and the knowledge of the past, the record of truths revealed by experience, is eminently practical, as an instrument of action and a power that goes to making the future.;Lord Acton;experience
Intuition is the very force or activity of the soul in its experience through whatever has been the experience of the soul itself.;Henry Reed;experience
Producing is just a big learning experience.;Ashley Tisdale;experience
Experience taught me that working families are often just one pay check away from economic disaster. And it showed me first-hand the importance of every family having access to good health care.;Dave Obey;experience
Existence itself does not feel horrible it feels like an ecstasy, rather, which we have only to be still to experience.;John Updike;experience
But constant experience shows us that every man invested with power is apt to abuse it, and to carry his authority as far as it will go.;Charles de Secondat;experience
Advertising is the edge of what people know how to do and of human experience and it explains the latest ways progress has changed us to ourselves.;Jaron Lanier;experience
I think everyone's experience with a terminal disease is so deeply personal and unique to the person, the context in which they're living and the relationships that they have.;Laura Linney;experience
My experience is that's rare - that you have a script that is... what they call 'film-ready.';Laura Linney;experience
There is only one thing which can master the perplexed stuff of epic material into unity and that is, an ability to see in particular human experience some significant symbolism of man's general destiny.;Lascelles Abercrombie;experience
The monsters of our childhood do not fade away, neither are they ever wholly monstrous. But neither, in my experience, do we ever reach a plane of detachment regarding our parents, however wise and old we may become. To pretend otherwise is to cheat.;John le Carre;experience
A spy, like a writer, lives outside the mainstream population. He steals his experience through bribes and reconstructs it.;John le Carre;experience
Mysteriously and in ways that are totally remote from natural experience, the gray drizzle of horror induced by depression takes on the quality of physical pain.;William Styron;experience
The sole substitute for an experience which we have not ourselves lived through is art and literature.;Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn;experience
I'd done table reads for my own screenplays, and I always thought they were so much fun. Why couldn't we do these for other classic screenplays and bring them to life? You can experience live theater, where you get to see plays produced by different directors and different casts, but there's really nothing like that for movie scripts.;Jason Reitman;experience
We see our customers as invited guests to a party, and we are the hosts. It's our job every day to make every important aspect of the customer experience a little bit better.;Jeff Bezos;experience
The crucial question one comes back to is the examination without that experience is meaningless. And I think it's true that society is becoming more and more passive, less and less fired up with enthusiasm, in many spheres.;Peter Hammill;experience
Life it is not just a series of calculations and a sum total of statistics, it's about experience, it's about participation, it is something more complex and more interesting than what is obvious.;Daniel Libeskind;experience
Artists need some kind of stimulating experience a lot of times, which crystallizes when you sing about it or paint it or sculpt it. You literally mold the experience the way you want. It's therapy.;Erykah Badu;experience
Sometimes I think our problems are made worse by the kind of business we're in. Playing these road shows is a weird experience.;Loretta Lynn;experience
Prudence is but experience, which equal time, equally bestows on all men, in those things they equally apply themselves unto.;Thomas Hobbes;experience
Many women my age have known the experience of giving up crucial parts of themselves to please the man they love.;Joyce Maynard;experience
I want people to think of me as a nice person. I really am so blessed. All of this has been a great experience and I thank the American public so much for putting me in this position. I appreciate every second of it.;Carrie Underwood;experience
It has always amazed me how tax cuts don't work until they take effect. Mr. Obama's experience with deferred tax rate increases will be the reverse. The economy will collapse in 2011.;Arthur Laffer;experience
Men and women who have served in harm's way experience higher rates of divorce and suicide. Many battle the debilitating effects and stigma associated with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.;Ron Wyden;experience
No matter how close to personal experience a story might be, inevitably you are going to get to a part that isn't yours and, actually, whether it happened or not becomes irrelevant. It is all about choosing the right words.;Roddy Doyle;experience
The bullied straight kid goes home to a shoulder to cry on and support and can talk freely about his experience at school and why he's being bullied. I couldn't go home and open up to my parents.;Dan Savage;experience
When you go to the movies with your whole family, it's a different experience. For some reason, it's something that you're all doing together and you take away something special in that.;Vin Diesel;experience
Making an album should be an honest experience. It shouldn't be about trying to gauge where popular music is today it should be about artistic expression and putting down what you want to put down.;Scott Weiland;experience
My life path has been a blessing and a great learning experience. Skateboarding is my passion and I don't see that changing. When I'm not skating, I love to surf. I'm open to the new experiences and opportunities.;Ryan Sheckler;experience
However it is debased or misinterpreted, love is a redemptive feature. To focus on one individual so that their desires become superior to yours is a very cleansing experience.;Jeanette Winterson;experience
All of the legal defense funds out there, they're looking for people out there with court of appeals experience, because court of appeals is where policy is made. And I know, I know this is on tape and I should never say that because we don't make law, I know. I know.;Sonia Sotomayor;experience
Fun is to experience things you would not have been able to experience in any other setting.;Mike Krzyzewski;experience
I have this horrible sense of humor where I think discomfort is funny - partly because I experience discomfort a lot, and it's a way of laughing at it and getting a release.;Joaquin Phoenix;experience
I was emotionally and physically punched in the stomach. This is not a place where you go and deliver the lines and then you come back. It's kind of a life-changing experience. But it can't get better than this for any actor - this is like an opera.;Javier Bardem;experience
No characters in 'Stay Close,' including the leads, are black and white. I want them to be grey. I think that makes for a much more interesting reading experience, something that will stay with you a little bit longer.;Harlan Coben;experience
Fatigue is what we experience, but it is what a match is to an atomic bomb.;Laura Hillenbrand;experience
I have relationships with people I'm working with, based on our combined interest. It doesn't make the relationship any less sincere, but it does give it a focus that may not last beyond the experience.;Harrison Ford;experience

We need creativity in order to break free from the temporary structures that have been set up by a particular sequence of experience.;Edward de Bono;experience
A great deal has been written in recent years about the purported lack of motivation in the children of the Negro ghettos. Little in my experience supports this, yet the phrase has been repeated endlessly, and the blame in almost all cases is placed somewhere outside the classroom.;Jonathan Kozol;experience
Though 'Fire and Rain' is very personal, for other people it resonates as a sort of commonly held experience... And that's what happens with me. I write things for personal reasons, and then in some cases it... can be a shared experience.;James Taylor;experience
I know there are people who don't like their audience or like the experience of being recognized or celebrated, but my audience has been very good - they don't bother me and when they do contact me it's usually on the nicest possible terms.;James Taylor;experience
Performing is a profound experience, at least for me. It's not as if I sit down and play 'Fire and Rain' by myself, just to hear it again. But to offer it up... the energy that it somehow summons live takes me right back, and I do get a reconnection to the emotions.;James Taylor;experience
Performing is a profound experience, at least for me.;James Taylor;experience
I've told people who have just started to make a film that the one thing you might experience is this feeling that everybody is conspiring against you, because you're not necessarily able to tell what's real and what's not.;Gus Van Sant;experience
The American experience influenced my understanding of individuality, basic human rights, freedom of expression and the rights and responsibilities of citizens.;Ai Weiwei;experience
My own experience is that a certain kind of genius among students is best brought out in bed.;Allen Ginsberg;experience
To the artist is sometimes granted a sudden, transient insight which serves in this matter for experience. A flash, and where previously the brain held a dead fact, the soul grasps a living truth! At moments we are all artists.;Arnold Bennett;experience
Anything that's different from your own realm of experience as a human being, whether it's driving a car or a boat, or using guns, anything that separates you from yourself and leads you more towards this character's existence is a big help.;Colin Farrell;experience
I remember when I took Quentin Tarantino with me to a very private screening of the documentary 'Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired,' which shows some of the legal irregularities of his case. I was involved by the film, and it was an amazing experience to see people weep at the end of it.;Harvey Weinstein;experience
What is truth? Truth doesn't really exist. Who is going to judge whether my experience of an incident is more valid than yours? No one can be trusted to be the judge of that.;Tracey Emin;experience
America is an idea. And it's the solemn responsibility of each 'temporary' president to protect and nurture that noblest of all ideas - with integrity. This man, Mitt Romney, has shown - not through his experience, but through his actions and words - that he is unqualified to carry out that responsibility.;Jennifer Granholm;experience
I absolutely believe in the power of tithing and giving back. My own experience about all the blessings I've had in my life is that the more I give away, the more that comes back. That is the way life works, and that is the way energy works.;Ken Blanchard;experience
Every day is a new experience and I take it as it comes.;Zac Efron;experience
Reading a book is like re-writing it for yourself. You bring to a novel, anything you read, all your experience of the world. You bring your history and you read it in your own terms.;Angela Carter;experience
Some of us are interested in directors, but really the vast majority of us are interested in actors. You experience the films through the actors, so they're all locked into your imagination in some kind of layer of fantasy or hatred or wherever they settle into your imagination.;Danny Boyle;experience
I don't want people to sit there and objectively watch the film. I want them to experience it as something that's under their skin, so you try to make the films really tactile.;Danny Boyle;experience
You experience the films through the actors, so they're all locked into your imagination in some kind of layer of fantasy or hatred or wherever they settle into your imagination.;Danny Boyle;experience
I think it's easy for people to assume that fame is equal to glory, but it can be a very isolating experience.;Sophia Bush;experience
Orlando's a really cool guy. They hired him for 'Lord of the Rings' out of drama school. He's very new at this still and doesn't have a lot of experience. So we were in this together and we've tried to help each other out. We felt very equal which was good.;Diane Kruger;experience
I have three goddaughters - I'm not sure why they trust me, because I have no experience with children - but I try.;Diane Kruger;experience
I left Jamaica for a while, because as an artist I need to experience different things, see the world, have different energies. Living in one place is not good for me.;Ziggy Marley;experience
I always considered myself as a character actor. I always try to be versatile to show different sides of human experience.;Robert Duvall;experience
I think I can make an entirely new game experience, and if I can't do it, some other game designer will.;Shigeru Miyamoto;experience
I don't think as a creator that I could create an experience that truly feels interactive if you don't have something to hold in your hand, if you don't have something like force feedback that you can feel from the controller.;Shigeru Miyamoto;experience
Games have grown and developed from this limited in-the-box experience to something that's everywhere now. Interactive content is all around us, networked, ready. This is something I've been hoping for throughout my career.;Shigeru Miyamoto;experience
The spectacles of experience through them you will see clearly a second time.;Henrik Ibsen;experience
I'm a very passionate believer in the unity of knowledge. There is one world of reality - one world of our experience that we're seeking to describe.;John Polkinghorne;experience
Bottom up thinkers try to start from experience and move from experience to understanding. They don't start with certain general principles they think beforehand are likely to be true they just hope to find out what reality is like.;John Polkinghorne;experience
When I'm home on a break, I lock myself in my room and play guitar. After two or three hours, I start getting into this total meditation. It's a feeling few people experience, and that's usually when I come up with weird stuff. It just flows. I can't force myself. I don't sit down and say I've got to practice.;Eddie Van Halen;experience
A lot of people fear death because they think that so overwhelming an experience has to be painful, but I've seen quite a few deaths, and, with one exception, I've never known anyone to undergo anything like agony. That's amazing when you think about it. I mean, how complicated the mechanism is that's being taken apart.;Lewis Thomas;experience
But beginners to the World Economics Forum have to understand there is no single Davos experience, and there is no single Davos community either. There are numerous tribes who interact only at a minimal level.;Evan Davis;experience
It's always an interesting experience for a politician to be heard in silence, I have to say.;Theresa May;experience
It's a very small and select slice of all the people who have ever been born. I believe we've come back during this time, those of us who are here now, specifically to experience it. And to cause a 'quickening of the spirit.';Neale Donald Walsch;experience
I wanted to experience New York, to look up and see buildings.;Haile Gebrselassie;experience
A rare experience of a moment at daybreak, when something in nature seems to reveal all consciousness, cannot be explained at noon. Yet it is part of the day's unity.;Charles Ives;experience
I think I have a tendency to look at things subjectively rather than objectively when I reflect on my experience.;Ricky Williams;experience
Age should not have its face lifted, but it should rather teach the world to admire wrinkles as the etchings of experience and the firm line of character.;Clarence Day;experience
Age is only a number, a cipher for the records. A man can't retire his experience. He must use it. Experience achieves more with less energy and time.;Bernard Baruch;experience
Women artists need to break barriers in order for women's experience to be valuable.;Liz Phair;experience
I think generally I'm kind of interested in subjective experience, what goes on inside someone's head, that being all they really know of the world.;Charlie Kaufman;experience
The wisdom and experience of older people is a resource of inestimable worth. Recognizing and treasuring the contributions of older people is essential to the long-term flourishing of any society.;Daisaku Ikeda;experience
A commitment to human rights cannot be fostered simply through the transmission of knowledge. Action and experience play a crucial role in the learning process.;Daisaku Ikeda;experience
Writing a novel is a terrible experience, during which the hair often falls out and the teeth decay.;Flannery O'Connor;experience
Lord of the Rings was my first experience making movies and at the time, I had no ideas how movies were done. I thought that's the way they're done, so in a way, I had nothing to compare it to.;Orlando Bloom;experience
I'm not particularly precious about the theatrical experience any more.;Edward Norton;experience
A lot of why I do something is just the novelty of the experience.;Edward Norton;experience
Every experience feeds an actor, and I've learned that depression is all around us.;Bryan Cranston;experience
I want to be able to experience everything. I want to experience being a husband, experience being a father, experience, maybe, hopefully, someday being a grandfather, and all those things. I want that experience. When I die, I want to be exhausted.;Bryan Cranston;experience
All experience is subjective.;Gregory Bateson;experience
We have that illusion that we are 'deciding' what to make a character do, in order to 'convey our message' or something like that. But, at least in my experience, you are often more like a river-rafting guide who's been paid a bonus to purposely steer your clients into the roughest possible water.;George Saunders;experience
If you haven't read you don't have the voice. The lack of voice eliminates experience.;George Saunders;experience
Although our inattention can contribute to our lack of total well-being, we also have the power to choose positive behaviors and responses. In that choice we change our every experience of life!;Greg Anderson;experience
I'm very accepting with my age. It's like notches on your belt: experience, wisdom, and a different kind of beauty. There comes a day when you've become comfortable in your skin.;Zoe Saldana;experience
A statesman wants courage and a statesman wants vision but believe me, after six months' experience, he wants first, second, third and all the time - patience.;Stanley Baldwin;experience
Through the years of experience I have found that air offers less resistance than dirt.;Jack Nicklaus;experience
You have to trust your kids. They have to experience life, and you just hope you've provided them a foundation for what's right and what isn't.;Jack Nicklaus;experience
I had great faith in Irish actors, that they'd be hip to the whole theatre thing, and they are. I had no illusions of coming over here as some kind of big shot. It's been a learning experience for me too.;Christopher Meloni;experience
You can live your whole life in your brain and not experience what's around you. You go crazy that way.;Fiona Apple;experience
No matter how vital experience might be while you lived it, no sooner was it ended and dead than it became as lifeless as the piles of dry dust in a school history book.;Ellen Glasgow;experience
Doesn't all experience crumble in the end to mere literary material?;Ellen Glasgow;experience
I started off on stage because it was the only work I could get. I haven't been back for 11 years. I think any stage experience is good experience, as far as being an actor is concerned.;Tim Roth;experience
No one ever pretended that shopping for anything is a rational experience. If it were, would there be Fluffernutter? Laceless sneakers? Porkpie hats? Would the Chia Pet even exist?;Jeffrey Kluger;experience
My own life has in some ways been a decades-long tour of the sibling experience. I have full sibs, I have half-sibs, and for a time I had step-sibs.;Jeffrey Kluger;experience
There are a lot of obstacles in the way of our understanding animal intelligence - not the least being that we can't even agree whether nonhuman species are conscious. We accept that chimps and dolphins experience awareness we like to think dogs and cats do. But what about mice and newts? What about a fly? Is anything going on there at all?;Jeffrey Kluger;experience
As with real reading, the ability to comprehend subtlety and complexity comes only with time and a lot of experience. If you don't adequately acquire those skills, moving out into the real world of real people can actually become quite scary.;Jeffrey Kluger;experience
Bringing an end to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians may help the young Arab generation to realise their aspirations. Israel is more than willing to offer our experience in building a modern economy in spite of limited resources to the whole region.;Shimon Peres;experience
I like directors who have worked as actors. They know the experience.;Gabrielle Union;experience
Yes, I've listened to just a few audiobooks - but hope to listen to more. I've wanted to investigate how my own books sound in this format and find the experience of listening, and not reading, quite fascinating.;Joyce Carol Oates;experience
There's no wrong way to experience a film.;Vera Farmiga;experience
I wouldn't say I'm a very original thinker, but if I have a good experience with something, I'll want to take it further or adapt it in some way.;Gwyneth Paltrow;experience
For me, titles are either a natural two-second experience or stressful enough to give you an ulcer. If they don't pop out perfect on the first try, they can be really hard to repair. Or, worse, if the author thinks they pop out perfect, but the publishing house does not agree, it's difficult to shift gears. And then? Then you go insane.;Sloane Crosley;experience
Stories have always been the things that entertain me and make me feel happy and sad and move me and give me the experience of being able to live many lives in one lifetime. It's the best thing about being alive.;Michael Sheen;experience
If you're out there stressing on your pro day, then you're not going to perform well, so I plan on having a little fun. Play a little music while we're out there throwing the football, have everybody tapping their toes and bobbing their head and just go out there and make the most of the experience.;Robert Griffin III;experience
I find increasingly that the more extreme are the things going on in your life, the more cultural reference points fail you. More mythical reference points actually help, and you realise that's what myths are for. It's for human beings to process their experience in extremis.;Michael Sheen;experience
I think being a parent is the most challenging thing you do. That's why we're here. It's at the heart of what it is to be a human being. It's the ultimate experience because it questions everything about who you are. But it's difficult.;Michael Sheen;experience
If one area I felt it was a tough election was I couldn't see my young son and I couldn't see my wife a lot, but apart from that for her also it was an experience.;Imran Khan;experience
In fact the experience at Oxford has really helped me later in life.;Imran Khan;experience
I was quite able at the insignificant work I did in MI6, but absolutely dysfunctional in my domestic life. I had no experience of fatherhood. I had no example of marital bliss or the family unit.;John le Carre;experience
As an actress, it's part of your job to be able to imagine just about anything - even if it's not within your personal experience.;Rachel Weisz;experience
If you search and search and stop searching, then ultimately you'll find what you need. It is the experience of living.;Marion Cotillard;experience
Writing a story or a novel is one way of discovering sequence in experience, of stumbling upon cause and effect in the happenings of a writer's own life.;Eudora Welty;experience
I learn from experience.;Alan Dershowitz;experience
It's always good to get a smaller tournament under your belt so that by the time you get to the Slams, you have a lot of experience.;Serena Williams;experience

Yes, all my songs come from personal experience and relationships.;Rick Springfield;experience
The essence of a role-playing game is that it is a group, cooperative experience.;Gary Gygax;experience
I think newspapers shouldn't try to compete directly with the Web, and should do what they can do better, which may be long-form journalism and using photos and art, and making connections with large-form graphics and really enhancing the tactile experience of paper.;Dave Eggers;experience
Well, my background is journalism. I don't have any creative-writing experience except for one class I took as a sophomore in college.;Dave Eggers;experience
Religion points to that area of human experience where in one way or another man comes upon mystery as a summons to pilgrimage.;Frederick Buechner;experience
Do I ever think Gossip will be really massive in America? No, I don't think it'll happen - and that's fine. It's kind of nice because I get to experience everything at once. I get to come home and it not be weird, like in Paris or something. It is nice to be completely anonymous.;Beth Ditto;experience
Great art - or good art - is when you look at it, experience it and it stays in your mind. I don't think conceptual art and traditional art are all that different.;Damien Hirst;experience
These are tough times and under this Tory-led government many people in Manchester are suffering and getting left behind. If elected I will use all my energy, skills, experience and knowledge to stand up for our communities and get things done for the better.;Lucy Powell;experience
I guess my experience with some stuff is kind of abstract.;Joaquin Phoenix;experience
For me, I'd rather have an intense experience than not.;Joaquin Phoenix;experience
Boredom is the dream bird that hatches the egg of experience. A rustling in the leaves drives him away.;Walter Benjamin;experience
I wouldn't go up on a stage now if you paid a thousand dollars for one minute of acting. It's a nasty experience. You're up there all by yourself. You're so damn exposed.;Elia Kazan;experience
I was never afraid of failure after that because, I think, coming that close to death you get kissed. With the years, the actual experience of course fades, but the flavor of it doesn't. I just had a real sense of what choice do I have but to live fully?;Debra Winger;experience
My parents had an experience of life that is as opposite to mine as you can imagine.;Jane Pauley;experience
It's wonderful to be in love. And it's definitely wonderful to cuddle and have sex and get to experience life with somebody. But it's OK if you don't find him and you're 24. You can find it someday.;Leighton Meester;experience
No matter what his position or experience in life, there is in everyone more latent than developed ability far more unused than used power.;James Cash Penney;experience
I felt alienated by the experience and decided to stay away from corporate employment.;Lee Child;experience
The printed page conveys information and commitment, and requires active involvement. Television conveys emotion and experience, and it's very limited in what it can do logically. It's an existential experience - there and then gone.;Bill Moyers;experience
None of us feels the true love of God till we realize how wicked we are. But you can't teach people that - they have to learn by experience.;Dorothy L. Sayers;experience
I enjoy writing but I much prefer the experience of having written.;Fareed Zakaria;experience
The fact that I am a writer comes from the experience of being cut away from my roots and living in Venezuela, where I couldn't find a place for myself, for years and years.;Isabel Allende;experience
People were being so mean as a result of my ability - a gift, really. So I think that's what makes me fight harder to provide an option to aspiring kids or artists. I wouldn't want anyone to go through what I went through... to see a little girl or a little dancer experience such unnecessary rejection.;Laurieann Gibson;experience
I have the ordinary experience of being anonymous when I'm in an airplane talking to air-traffic control, and they don't know who they're talking to. I have a lot of common experiences.;Harrison Ford;experience
To me, the job of the artist is to provide a useful and intelligent vocabulary for the world to be able to articulate feelings they experience everyday, and otherwise wouldn't have the means to express in a meaningful and useful way.;Mos Def;experience
Making movies is a very different experience in a lot of ways. It's difficult when you're used to owning the copyright and having a landlord's possessory rights - I rent my plays to the companies that do them and, if I'm upset, I can pull the play. But the only two directors I've worked with are pretty great.;Tony Kushner;experience
Acting can be a narrow and isolated experience, because you only examine your particular part.;Damian Lewis;experience
In my experience, there is only one motivation, and that is desire. No reasons or principle contain it or stand against it.;Jane Smiley;experience
That's one of the benefits of working on big budget films. You work with people who have a lot of experience and you get to learn a lot.;Liev Schreiber;experience
I was an only child. I've known only children. From this experience, I do believe that the children should outnumber the parents.;Jane Smiley;experience
Film is such a bizarre vehicle for acting. It's such a bizarre experience. I don't think you ever really get familiar with it. If you do get familiar with it, you're probably not that good anymore.;Liev Schreiber;experience
When a novel has 200,000 words, then it is possible for the reader to experience 200,000 delights, and to turn back to the first page of the book and experience them all over again, perhaps more intensely.;Jane Smiley;experience
I definitely feel more complete than before. There's a void you have when you don't feel you've found the other part of who you are, so I'm in a different place now and that's nice to experience.;Mariah Carey;experience
I think it's really, really important to mix it up as an actor, to try to get as much kind of varied experience as you can, not only for your own personal growth as an actor but for the audience to keep them guessing about what you're going to do.;Liev Schreiber;experience
I'm a method writer. In order to write about the emotion, I have to experience it. I get physically tired and exhausted, devoting hours and hours and hours to it.;Sherman Alexie;experience
You can't dodge them all. I got hammered plenty of times through the years. But you just get up and keep playing. I can tell you from experience, though. Sometimes it hurts like hell.;Terry Bradshaw;experience
It is often difficult to watch yourself onscreen, especially 60-feet high. As an actor, it is an uncomfortable experience.;Chris Hemsworth;experience
I've learned through experience of playing different characters, some of whom were jerks, that when you play a character who is pretentious or obnoxious, in any way, it's important to knock them down a peg.;Jonah Hill;experience
I have a mess in my head sometimes, and there's something very satisfying about putting it into words. Certainly it's not something that you're in charge of, necessarily, but writing about it, putting it into your words, can be a very powerful experience.;Carrie Fisher;experience
A city building, you experience when you walk a suburban building, you experience when you drive.;Helmut Jahn;experience
My worst hair experience was when I was trying to relax my hair and my grandmother did it. It went all straight and I looked like a black Bee Gee.;Jamie Foxx;experience
Actually, music gave me the support when I needed it. I would never have gone to college unless I'd gotten a piano scholarship. And now I'm so glad I got to learn to play the cello, which is a different experience, you're flexing a different muscle, but it's beautiful because it is music.;Jamie Foxx;experience
I hate these platforms that are all over the place today they are all about grabbing attention. They are suburban! I never do a platform. Well, I did, in the 1970s, but that was a bad experience.;Manolo Blahnik;experience
There's full consensus in the military that women shouldn't be in person-to-person combat. I don't know if we have enough experience to know whether this is the right approach. But women can be elsewhere. We have mandatory military service in Chile. I pushed for women in all areas.;Michelle Bachelet;experience
Practical wisdom is only to be learned in the school of experience. Precepts and instruction are useful so far as they go, but, without the discipline of real life, they remain of the nature of theory only.;Samuel Smiles;experience
Our subjective experience of time is highly variable. We all know that days can pass like weeks and months can feel like years, and that the opposite can be just as true: A month or year can zoom by in what feels like no time at all.;Joshua Foer;experience
The experience gathered from books, though often valuable, is but the nature of learning whereas the experience gained from actual life is one of the nature of wisdom.;Samuel Smiles;experience
Just as we accumulate memories of facts by integrating them into a network, we accumulate life experiences by integrating them into a web of other chronological memories. The denser the web, the denser the experience of time.;Joshua Foer;experience
Experience teaches us that we do not always receive the blessings we ask for in prayer.;Mary Baker Eddy;experience
My father respected and admired my mother and was a person who was always standing by my side, encouraging me to do more and believed in my capacity. So in that sense, my own experience was very good in becoming an empowered woman. From early on, I carried that strong message: 'You can do it.' So I never had any doubt that women can do a lot.;Michelle Bachelet;experience
Other people do not have to change for us to experience peace of mind.;Gerald Jampolsky;experience
I believe that being an actress or being involved in a movie has to be a life experience, otherwise why go for it? I have to change me, and I have to learn things, and I have to push me and my limits. By acting, I find a freedom inside of a prison in a way.;Juliette Binoche;experience
Like every aspect of cancer I've weathered thus far, today's experience was not at all demoralizing, expensive or humiliating. No, it was just plain fun.;April Winchell;experience
Life is full of change and uncertainty. We know this. We experience it on a daily basis.;Carre Otis;experience
I've had a fair amount of experience with snakes, and I find them to be pretty honest in terms of how you read their body language and emotions. They'll tell you when they're grumpy. They'll tell you when they're okay.;Dominic Monaghan;experience
Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't.;Pete Seeger;experience
I had such a close relationship with my dog, and my dog so filled the need in my life to have children that I just wanted Cathy to have that experience.;Cathy Guisewite;experience
Baseball is a rookie, his experience no bigger than the lump in his throat as he begins fulfillment of his dream.;Ernie Harwell;experience
If the experience of science teaches anything, it's that the world is very strange and surprising. The many revolutions in science have certainly shown that.;John Polkinghorne;experience
The impulse to dream was slowly beaten out of me by experience. Now it surged up again and I hungered for books, new ways of looking and seeing.;Richard Wright;experience
I think theatre is by far the most rewarding experience for an actor. You get 4 weeks to rehearse your character and then at 7:30 pm you start acting and nobody stops you, acting with your entire soul.;Christopher Eccleston;experience
But in the back of my mind I've always looked to the biggest-scale Hollywood movies. Because to me the most satisfying experience is of watching a movie, if it's done really well. And so that aspiration is always it for me, if I have the opportunity to do it.;Christopher Nolan;experience
Man tells his aspiration in his God but in his demon he shows his depth of experience.;Margaret Fuller;experience
In my experience, it's all wonderful with girls until about 16. Around that time, boys kind of calm down and start focusing their testosterone. Girls get a little challenging, especially for fathers.;Tim Allen;experience
Whenever something happens that makes me laugh or if I remember something in the middle of the night that I want to share, I jot the experience down.;Tori Spelling;experience
My kids will grow up in a house knowing that it's perfectly normal for two men to be in love, it's perfectly normal for two women to be in love. My kids will grow up knowing it's all about love. It doesn't matter who you're with and everyone should have that experience.;Tori Spelling;experience
I'd like to work with Justin Bieber. He's talented and he's so young. I know what he's going through. I've lived what he's living through right now. Working with him would complete a circle of sorts for me. And he might find it a worthwhile experience himself.;Donny Osmond;experience
'Donny and Marie' was a great experience. I tried so hard to be a great talk show host but it's all about relaxing and enjoying it. Marie and I finally figured that out. I would have liked it to continue but I'm kind of glad it's over because of the phenomenal workload.;Donny Osmond;experience
I didn't go to high school, so I don't have a high school experience. I was home-schooled during high school.;Josh Hutcherson;experience
My faith experience, well, as you can imagine, you need a lot of faith to raise five boys.;Ann Romney;experience
It's been quite an experience, being conservative and living in the North East.;Ann Romney;experience
There can be nothing exclusive about substantial art. It comes directly out of the heart of the experience of life and thinking about life and living life.;Charles Ives;experience
I decided blacks should not have to experience the difficulties I had faced, so I decided to open a flying school and teach other black women to fly.;Bessie Coleman;experience
The only time I ever went hunting I remembered it as a grisly experience.;Gloria Swanson;experience
When you do find humor in trying times, one of the first and most important changes you experience is that you see your perplexing problems in a new way - you suddenly have a new perspective on them.;Allen Klein;experience
My Marine experience helped shape who I am now personally and professionally, and I am grateful for that on an almost daily basis.;Jim Lehrer;experience
A sense of freedom is something that, happily, comes with age and life experience.;Diane Keaton;experience
The act of writing... is the act of trying to understand why my opinion is what it is. And ultimately, I think that's the same experience the reader has when they pick up one of my books.;Jodi Picoult;experience
To pursue a so-called Third Way is foolish. We had our experience with this in the 1960s when we looked for a socialism with a human face. It did not work, and we must be explicit that we are not aiming for a more efficient version of a system that has failed.;Vaclav Klaus;experience
And I thought, when I have kids, that's the sort of well told, silly, and fun fairy tale that I would want to take them to. But it was an amazing experience. And I think Shrek is a real classic, a fairy tale classic.;Mike Myers;experience
I would love to be a father. I had a great father who taught me how gratifying that is. I'm not going to deny myself that. I think I'd be good at it. Everybody wants that experience. I definitely do.;Mike Myers;experience
You can never regret anything you do in life. You kind of have to learn the lesson from whatever the experience is and take it with you on your journey forward.;Aubrey O'Day;experience
When I go to my live shows it's often a multigenerational audience, a family bonding experience.;Al Yankovic;experience
Directing is a more pragmatic experience, where you have to deal with the restrictions of time and money that force you to make certain decisions you don't have to make when you're writing.;Charlie Kaufman;experience
When I'm writing, I'm trying to immerse myself in the chaos of an emotional experience, rather than separate myself from it and look back at it from a distance with clarity and tell it as a story. Because that's how life is lived, you know?;Charlie Kaufman;experience
I think you just assume that your memory is just sort of a video playback of your experience, but it's nothing like that at all. It's a complete refabrication of an event and a lot of it is made up, because you're filling in spaces.;Charlie Kaufman;experience
Reading the play at home, however fulfilling, can never be the vivacious experience that Shakespeare intended.;Arthur Smith;experience
Learning is a tunnel experience that makes us think more broadly.;Anna Deavere Smith;experience
In life there are no problems, that is, objective and external choices there is only the life which we do not resolve as a problem but which we live as an experience, whatever the final result may be.;Alberto Moravia;experience
Have you ever watched someone become American? Last week, at a national citizenship conference I organize, thirty immigrants from 17 countries swore an oath and became citizens of the United States. It was a stirring experience for the hundreds of people in the room.;Eric Liu;experience
People who run for president seriously and people who become president enter a bizarre secret society in which they have had an experience that none of us will ever have.;John Hodgman;experience
The most experience I had in the criminology field is playing a thug as an actor. That was my first paid job. The police academy at the college was paying people to reenact the calls that potential cops would get. So I got to play thugs and people who were unruly.;Jeremy Renner;experience
It was a very profound experience, getting in touch with that part of us, in all of us human beings, that is committed beyond yourself to the point of giving everything you have, including your life, for other people, for your fellow man.;Raul Julia;experience
While I was trying to save money to go to the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Australia I ended up getting all of this experience which meant that by the time I had enough money in the bank to go to school I didn't really need to go to school anymore.;Russell Crowe;experience
You can learn more from the lows than the highs. The highs are great but the lows make you really look at things in a different way and want to improve. Every player will have both in their careers and I have, but what you get is that experience which is so important to perform at your best.;Wayne Rooney;experience
As is known, it is in the realm of experience inaugurated by psychoanalysis that we may grasp along what imaginary lines the human organism, in the most intimate recesses of its being, manifests its capture in a symbolic dimension.;Jacques Lacan;experience
I think the most interesting parts of human experience might be the sparks that come from that sort of chipping flint of cultures rubbing against each other. And living on the border between Mexico and the U.S. for so many years gave me a lot of insight into that.;Barbara Kingsolver;experience
I eventually became proud of my strikeouts, because each one represented another learning experience.;Willie Stargell;experience
I think experience will teach you a combination of liberalism and conservatism. We have to be progressive and at the same time we have to retain values. We have to hold onto the past as we explore the future.;Oliver Stone;experience
I would vote for the man who's lived life, who's done different occupations, who's been out in the real world and struggled to make a living, struggled to raise a family, struggled with life as it exists. So I'd vote for experience, honest experience.;Oliver Stone;experience
It was a great experience for a kid, because it was a bunch of kids playing on pirate ships and water slides, so looking back on it, it was the fondest experience of my childhood.;Corey Feldman;experience
We certainly want those at the top to do well, but if you base your entire presidency and your entire economic platform on helping them do even better, you're missing what makes the economy tick. Because not everyone has been as fortunate as Mitt Romney, you cannot base your whole approach on a life experience as rarified as his.;Charles Schumer;experience
There are many reasons why Mitt Romney should not become president, but perhaps the most important of all is the narrowness of his experience, perspective and vision.;Charles Schumer;experience
There are more people than you think who want to have a challenging experience, in which they are obliged to reflect about the past.;Umberto Eco;experience
When I'm writing, I'm constantly thinking about myself, because it's the only experience I have to draw on. And I don't see an exact reflection of myself in every face in the audience, but I know that my songs have validity to them, and that's why the fans are there.;Chester Bennington;experience
I think women don't grow up with the harsh world of criticism that men grow up with, we are more sensitively treated, and when you first experience the world of film-making you have to develop a very tough skin.;Jane Campion;experience
With 'Bright Star' and with 'The Piano,' too, I felt a kind of sadness about it being in such a different era, because of my lack of experience with the era. And one of the ways I'd get over it is to remind myself that every film, even if it's contemporary, creates its own world.;Jane Campion;experience
In almost everything, experience is more valuable than precept.;Quintilian;experience
You shouldn't be afraid of failure - when something fails, you think, 'What did I learn from that experience? I can do better next time.' Then kill that project and move on to the next. Don't get disappointed.;Niklas Zennstrom;experience
I think that the mark of a great book is that it will meet you wherever you're at and you'll feel and experience something new and different each time you read it.;Josh Radnor;experience
Well, I stopped drinking. That was actually a big deal. I didn't go through any harrowing rock-bottom experience. I just made a decision to stop drinking.;Josh Radnor;experience
Whatever it is you want to do, take a job in that field. You will learn by experience and, slow and steady, you'll get it done!;Rachael Ray;experience

One of the things in the back of my mind is that, after my sports experience, I never want to be, totally consumed by any one endeavor, other than my family life.;Julius Erving;experience
By experience we find out a short way by a long wandering.;Roger Ascham;experience
I think most artists will experience a lot of negative people on Twitter but, thank God, I've got so many followers that I'm not able to see them that much. I'll see some from time to time but, for the most part, I always focus on something good.;Nicki Minaj;experience
I think we're the only jokeless show on television. I mean really, we have no setups and no punch lines. It's not a joke show. There are funny lines and funny moments but again the comedy is born of the human experience and awkward pauses are a great part of what it is to be human.;Rainn Wilson;experience
Experience tells you what to do confidence allows you to do it.;Stan Smith;experience
My time at Shell was a most valuable experience because it taught me to look at the world in a long-term way. Shell takes a 20-year view on events and plans for different scenarios. It makes you see the world as a kind of large matrix.;Vince Cable;experience
I feel that between my experience and my mother's, breast cancer is a little bit like someone who lives next door. I know what that person looks like and what their daily habits are.;Cynthia Nixon;experience
An adolescent is somebody who is in between things. A teenager is somebody who's kind of permanently there. And so living with them through the various teenage hopes and sorrows and joys was curiously enough a maturing experience for me.;Andrew Greeley;experience
I raised five children. They all have different personalities. All of them have different issues, different levels of success. That was a learning experience for me.;T. D. Jakes;experience
Physics is experience, arranged in economical order.;Ernst Mach;experience
Individuals approaching death often experience encounters with their dead relatives, who seem to welcome them to the next world. These deathbed visions are authentic and convincing they are often followed by a state of euphoria and seem to ease the transition.;Stanislav Grof;experience
I read Freud's Introductory Lectures in Psychoanalysis in basically one sitting. I decided to enroll in medical school. It was almost like a conversion experience.;Stanislav Grof;experience
Dying before dying has two important consequences: It liberates the individual from the fear of death and influences the actual experience of dying at the time of biological demise.;Stanislav Grof;experience
I mean, I'm an uncle of seven or eight, and I don't mind it at all! Kids are great. Kids are the best six-hour experience you can have!;Chris O'Dowd;experience
By presenting a faithful and honest record of my experience as a mother, I hope to show both my readers and my children how truth can redeem even what you fear might be the gravest of sins.;Ayelet Waldman;experience
I have my team. Like if you see everyone around me - I have my hair and makeup girl, my assistant. They're very calm, they're all about positive energy. There're no drama queens. Everyone wants everyone else to have a positive experience. There are no agendas. I think it creates a healthy environment and there are no boundaries to cross.;Fergie;experience
When you're a soul singer, I'm singing a lot of songs about love and relationships that I think a lot of girls really relate to. For whatever reason, that seems to get 'em excited. The DJ, everyone always says the DJ gets all the chicks, but that's never been my experience.;Mayer Hawthorne;experience
My experience, with both my parents, is that grief has a lot of down, sad things, but I was also really emotionally raw, in the first year after each of them passed. Flowers smelled more intensely, my relationships were hotter, and I was more willing to risk. I was going for it a lot more. I was 'unsober' and I wasn't playing by my rules.;Mike Mills;experience
Quality is a direct experience independent of and prior to intellectual abstractions.;Robert M. Pirsig;experience
Although we have, in theory, abolished human slavery, recognized women's rights, and stopped child labor, we continue to enslave other species who, if we simply pay attention, show quite clearly that they experience parental love, pain, and the desire for freedom, just as we do.;Ingrid Newkirk;experience
Fundamental ideas are not a consequence of experience, but a result of the particular constitution and activity of the mind, which is independent of all experience in its origin, though constantly combined with experience in its exercise.;William Whewell;experience

Emigration, forced or chosen, across national frontiers or from village to metropolis, is the quintessential experience of our time.;John Berger;experience
Experience is that marvelous thing that enable you to recognize a mistake when you make it again.;Franklin P. Jones;experience
Films that are entertainments give simple answers but I think that's ultimately more cynical, as it denies the viewer room to think. If there are more answers at the end, then surely it is a richer experience.;Michael Haneke;experience
You can use your means in a good and bad way. In German-speaking art, we had such a bad experience with the Third Reich, when stories and images were used to tell lies. After the war, literature was careful not to do the same, which is why writers began to reflect on the stories they told and to make readers part of their texts. I do the same.;Michael Haneke;experience
What's great about the geek spirit is that life never seems to stop us, and they never seem to kill our enthusiasm, our optimism and our hunger to experience the world. We keep our sense of humor, we protect our dignity, we talk to our friends about the experience and then we start again fresh the very next day.;Paul Feig;experience
The greatest way for people to experience a comedy is to go in not knowing anything about it. But because of marketing, it's impossible. Marketing meaning that in order to get people to come you can't just go, 'Hey, there's a great movie - we're not going to show you anything from it but trust us!';Paul Feig;experience
At an incredibly divisive point in pop history, Donna Summer managed to create an undeniable across-the-board experience of mass pleasure - after 'Bad Girls,' nobody ever tried claiming disco sucked again. It set the template for what Michael Jackson would do a few months later with 'Off The Wall.';Rob Sheffield;experience
Watching the evening news in 2011 is a strange time-travel experience. 'The CBS Evening News,' 'ABC World News' and 'NBC Nightly News' haven't changed their style over the decades, still going for that old-fashioned mix of voice-of-authority pomp and feel-good fluff. The difference is that people aren't watching.;Rob Sheffield;experience
Acting is a very personal process. It has to do with expressing your own personality, and discovering the character you're playing through your own experience - so we're all different.;Ian Mckellen;experience
Enough of this occupation, terror and abuse. We are not in need of your help. We are able to combat and defeat terrorism, and achieve unity. We are not in need of your bases, your experience and etc.;Muqtada al Sadr;experience
I mean, I really liked those guys and the experience of doing Raiders was really good for me, but I did not really want to be involved - I only did Jedi, as I really owed George a favor.;Lawrence Kasdan;experience
Rhetoric and dialectics can't change what I have learned from observation and experience.;Paul Getty;experience
I'm a very professional man. I'm not out for the experience of adventure.;Werner Herzog;experience

While I was pleasantly surprised by the relatively high number of jobs created in April, the fact is that job creation during this recovery period has significantly lagged both historical experience in recovery, and the projections of the Bush Administration.;Barney Frank;experience

I just love to experience things. I would do almost anything once.;Brooke Burke;experience

Experience is the extract of suffering.;Arthur Helps;experience
There are people who never experience that, who remain closed until death, from fear of change.;Isabelle Adjani;experience
Capital isn't that important in business. Experience isn't that important. You can get both of these things. What is important is ideas.;Harvey S. Firestone;experience
Experience, already reduced to a group of impressions, is ringed round for each one of us by that thick wall of personality through which no real voice has ever pierced on its way to us, or from us to that which we can only conjecture to be without.;Walter Pater;experience
It was a very bizarre experience for me, to get the songs together, go in there, and try to deliver them as I would perhaps in a live setting. But I realized that I couldn't take on that coffeehouse style that I came from and go in there and burn it up.;Jason Mraz;experience
Well, for me, what I've learned at the very end of this, love is sharing, and I think that really is, for me, the best place to go to experience love, is sharing.;Jason Mraz;experience
In some movies you feel like you're a very small part of a huge machine. Whereas in the theater you can have a very small part, but you can still feel the weight and the gravity of it. Given the nature of theater, it's a more concentrated and quiet experience.;Minnie Driver;experience
Magicians lose the opportunity to experience a sense of wonder.;David Copperfield;experience
I didn't know if I had the music for it or if I could pull off the larger concert experience. Then I realized if I can just continue to be myself, I'll be all right.;Jason Mraz;experience

My films don't give you an easy ride. I can see that. The sense I get is that people have quite a physical experience with them. They feel afterwards that they've really been through something.;Andrea Arnold;experience
With a lot of films, people are sitting on the outside looking in, but I want the audience to get a bit more intimately involved with what's going on, so that they maybe can experience it a little bit more intensely.;Andrea Arnold;experience
If there's any object in human experience that's a precedent for what a computer should be like, it's a musical instrument: a device where you can explore a huge range of possibilities through an interface that connects your mind and your body, allowing you to be emotionally authentic and expressive.;Jaron Lanier;experience
I've had a great experience with pretty much everybody I've worked with.;Mia Wasikowska;experience

My ultimate aim is to make euthanasia a positive experience.;Jack Kevorkian;experience
Theatre, when it is at its best, takes a lot of beating - the live experience and the shared collective experience of live storytelling is really special when it is good. Particularly here in New York because the audiences are amazing, very vocal and very engaged, and that makes theatre very exciting.;Dan Stevens;experience
From my experience, politicians are much more uncomfortable being made fun of than they are being preached at and screeched at - you know, and the soapbox routine. They're much more uneasy knowing they're a target of ridicule.;Carl Hiaasen;experience
The underlying message of the Lancet article is that if you want to understand aggressive behaviour in children, look to the social and emotional environment in which they are growing up, and the values they bring to the viewing experience.;Hugh Mackay;experience

You know, I've learned a lot from every person I've collaborated with, from Madlib to Jean Grae and Hi-Tek, to Mos to DJ Quik, to even somebody like Jermaine Dupri. I've taken something important away from every experience.;Talib Kweli;experience
Not only did I avoid speaking of Salinger I resisted thinking about him. I did not reread his letters to me. The experience had been too painful.;Joyce Maynard;experience
If people choose to live their life in a way that does not confront the more troubling aspects of their experience, that's fine, if it works for them. But it will probably make them uncomfortable if they come up against somebody like me. So they just shouldn't! They shouldn't read my work!;Joyce Maynard;experience
There is no winning or losing, but rather the value is in the experience of imagining yourself as a character in whatever genre you're involved in, whether it's a fantasy game, the Wild West, secret agenst or whatever else. You get to sort of vicariously experience those things.;Gary Gygax;experience
If you believe your catcher is intelligent and you know that he has considerable experience, it is a good thing to leave the game almost entirely in his hands.;Bob Feller;experience
In my experience an appreciative letter from a fellow writer means a lot.;Ian Mcewan;experience
A twenty-one-year-old writer is likely to be inhibited by a lack of usable experience. Childhood and adolescence were something I knew.;Ian Mcewan;experience
I live with one foot in the sand and one in the snow. There's European egocentricity, and the African opposite. I normally say that my African experience has made me a better European.;Henning Mankell;experience
There are a lot of impractical things about owning a Porsche. But they're all offset by the driving experience. It really is unique. Lamborghinis and Ferraris come close. And they are more powerful, but they don't handle like a Porsche.;Kevin O'Leary;experience
But I just know from experience that accent wise, even if you're an accent genius, crossing the Atlantic is the hardest thing in the world either way.;Hugh Grant;experience
When he brought it to me four years ago, Rodney King had just arrived, I was involved in the clean-up of L.A. and I guess it was part of my experience.;Kathryn Bigelow;experience

And I like to convey my feelings, my emotions, my experience, the information I have to public use, public opinion.;Vicente Fox;experience
Certainly I've had the experience of thinking a person was one thing, and finding out they were another.;John Hawkes;experience
And then I went to 'Dawson's Creek,' which is a show that was, for better or for worse, all about the language. It was a word-perfect show, which I'd never had any experience with. And it was really shocking for me. I felt really hemmed in. At the time, it wasn't my favorite working experience.;Busy Philipps;experience
I had the closest thing I have ever had to an out-of-body experience lying in bed one morning. I turned on the 'Today' programme and item four on the news was: 'The shadow chancellor has ruled himself out of the leadership.' I lay there thinking that's interesting, then I realised it was me.;George Osborne;experience
It's been my experience that every time I think I know where it's at, it's usually somewhere else.;Blake Edwards;experience
The utmost thing is the user experience, to have the most useful experience.;Marissa Mayer;experience
Our theory is, if you need the user to tell you what you're selling, then you don't know what you're selling, and it's probably not going to be a good experience.;Marissa Mayer;experience
Truth be told, I'm not an easy man. I can be an entertaining one, though it's been my experience that most people don't want to be entertained. They want to be comforted.;Richard Russo;experience
The wisdom of the wise, and the experience of ages, may be preserved by quotation.;Isaac D'Israeli;experience
We believe that Lebanon has been the first real experience for all the Arabs.;Bashar al-Assad;experience

Putting is like wisdom - partly a natural gift and partly the accumulation of experience.;Arnold Palmer;experience
I have been blessed in many ways, and one of those is to have been born in Africa, for me a great treasure house of stories. I have been researching it since my infancy reading about it, talking to men and women who have spent their lives in this land, living it as I have and loving it as I do. I write almost entirely from my own experience.;Wilbur Smith;experience
I was thinking that we all learn by experience, but some of us have to go to summer school.;Peter De Vries;experience
Past experience with fiscal austerity at home and overseas strongly suggests that it is best for the economy's long-run performance to restrain government spending rather than raise taxes.;Mark Zandi;experience
It's really fun at night, because I can see the baby kicking. I can feel the knee or the foot. The baby is starting to get heavy, and it's a really incredible feeling. I'm so grateful I get to experience this.;Emily Procter;experience
When you go visiting countries, you start reading the history of the place and you start getting into the culture, and then you have to leave. In my experience, all countries have hidden treasures.;Jo Nesbo;experience
I've always loved the experience of working together with other people toward an artistic goal.;Trey Anastasio;experience
There are a lot of things that make up a performance, a lot of technical things. It isn't always just about pulling it up from the darkest recesses of your mind or your heart. It's your experience and your observation.;Robert Carlyle;experience

Women have no sympathy and my experience of women is almost as large as Europe.;Florence Nightingale;experience
An identity would seem to be arrived at by the way in which the person faces and uses his experience.;James Baldwin;experience

The world is given to me only once, not one existing and one perceived. Subject and object are only one. The barrier between them cannot be said to have broken down as a result of recent experience in the physical sciences, for this barrier does not exist.;Erwin Schrodinger;experience
There are some things you only learn through experience.;Joe Namath;experience
On the one hand, we'll never experience childbirth. On the other hand, we can open all our own jars.;Bruce Willis;experience

The experience is fundamentally different for buying from local businesses than it is for buying consumer goods.;Andrew Mason;experience

Being in love is the only transcendent experience.;Armistead Maupin;experience
I've had a lot of experience in independent film, and about how to choose. You've got to be very discerning about where you put your five bucks, and where you cut and what you don't cut.;Ethan Hawke;experience
Dramatic experience is not logical it may be subdued to the kind of coherence that we indicate when we speak, in criticism, of form.;Allen Tate;experience

The course of the flight up and down was exceedingly erratic, partly due to the irregularity of the air, and partly to lack of experience in handling this machine. The control of the front rudder was difficult on account of its being balanced too near the center.;Orville Wright;experience
I loved making Pure Country. It was a great learning experience for me, seeing another part of the entertainment industry.;George Strait;experience
I've never had issues with popularity. I was always a popular guy... I've always had friends and loved ones and everything, so it wasn't like, 'Oh man, I gotta fill some void that was left by high school.' I had a great high-school experience.;Jonah Hill;experience
I don't believe in the so-called Olympic spirit. I speak from personal experience. When China hosted the Games, it failed to include the people. The event was constructed without regard for their joy.;Ai Weiwei;experience
We are creating a unique experience. It's starts with how you see the building from a distance.;Helmut Jahn;experience
When you grow up in a family of languages, you develop a kind of casual fluency, so that languages, though differently colored, all seem transparent to experience.;David Antin;experience
My feeling about work is it's much more about the experience of doing it than the end product. Sometimes things that are really great and make lots of money are miserable to make, and vice versa.;Alan Cumming;experience
Music and language are a vital element. We, as actors and directors, offer it to people who want to experience it. Sometimes the actual meaning is less important than the words themselves.;Kenneth Branagh;experience

Judgment comes from experience and great judgment comes from bad experience.;Bob Packwood;experience

I got pregnant at 40 by surprise. It's funny, because when we found out we were pregnant, I said, 'Okay, let's experience that.' You just have to just go with it because it's rare.;Julianna Margulies;experience
Many children are natural fantasists, I think, perhaps because their imaginations have yet to be clobbered into submission by experience.;David Mitchell;experience

I want to swim in both directions at once. Desire success, court failure.;Alan Rickman;failure

Failure's a natural part of life.;John Malkovich;failure
I mean, I love L.A. - I love living here. But I wish that we could make things without the need to hit a home run every single time.

I think failure is nothing more than life's way of nudging you that you are off course. My attitude to failure is not attached to outcome, but in not trying. It is liberating. Most people attach failure to something not working out or how people perceive you. This way, it is about answering to yourself.;Sara Blakely;failure

If you try to do your best there is no failure.;Mike Farrell;failure

It's not that we fly by the seat of our pants. We're not afraid of failure.;Craig Ferguson;failure

My biggest failure is I have too many to talk about.;Dean Kamen;failure

I fear that our true motivation is about oil and our own flailing economy about the failure to destroy Al Qaeda and about revenge.;Dave Matthews;failure

I'm fully aware that things that resonate and become real hits are the exception to the rule, so much so that I've wired myself for failure.;Ron Perlman;failure
Before I was married, I didn't consider my failure to manage even basic hand tools a feminist inadequacy. I thought it had more to do with being Jewish.

We all struggle with our failure to communicate and our failure to reach beyond fear to love people.;Mira Sorvino;failure
I don't have a fear factor. Well, not much of one. And I'm willing to risk quite a lot - as a comedian, you're always risking a lot.

America traditionally represents the greatest possibility of someone's going from nothing to something. Why? In theory, if not practice, the government stays out of the way and lets individuals take risks and reap rewards or accept the consequences of failure.

We're born with success. It is only others who point out our failures, and what they attribute to us as failure.;Whoopi Goldberg;failure

Once you can accept failure, you can have fun and success.;Rickey Henderson;failure

In a sense it might even be said that our failure is to form habits: for, after all, habit is relative to a stereotyped world, and meantime it is only the roughness of the eye that makes two persons, things, situations, seem alike.;Walter Pater;failure
The attributes for entrepreneurs cut both ways. You need the ability to ignore inconvenient facts and see the world as it should be and not as it is. This inspires people to take huge leaps of faith. But this blindness to facts can be a liability, too. The characteristics that help entrepreneurs succeed can also lead to their failure.;Eric Ries;failure
I can't say I'm not grateful to have journalists writing about me as a genius. But I know it's not true. I'm not confused. I understand that success comes through a lot of failure and a lot of very embarrassing failure. People want to create the next Facebook, but they are too afraid to create the next Facemash.;Eric Ries;failure

Jobs for every American is doomed to failure because of modern automation and production.

You just had to have faith.;Leah Ward Sears;faith

Christians must share their faith in obedience to the Great Commission, because we are only seeing the fruit of sin this side of death.;Ray Comfort;faith

I'm a lapsed Quaker. I don't go to meetings any more. But I'm very drawn to Catholicism - all that glitter. I'd love to be a Catholic.

Every adolescent has that dream every century has that dream every revolutionary has that dream, to destroy the family.;Gertrude Stein;family

I want to make sure my family's straight.;Lil Wayne;family

My ultimate life dream project is my kids. My family.;Denzel Washington;family

I did come from a pretty independent-minded family.;David Hockney;family

I do not see my family life in any way, shape, or form as an opportunity for a photo.;Shania Twain;family

Having family responsibilities and concerns just has to make you a more understanding person.;Sandra Day O'Connor;family
A retired teacher paid $62,000 towards her pension and nothing, yes nothing, for full family medical, dental and vision coverage over her entire career.

For the first time ever I was taking the family on the road. We stayed with my in-laws, which on life's list of experiences ranks right below sitting in a tub full of scissors.;Jeff Foxworthy;family
There is an overwhelming amount of information available to us all on the web each day, not to mention what is shared with us by our family, friends, fans, and followers.

I love my friends and family, but I also love it when they can't find me and I can spend all day reading or walking all alone, in silence, eight thousand miles away from everyone. All alone and unreachable in a foreign country is one my most favorite possible things to be.;Elizabeth Gilbert;family
They say Yogi Berra is funny. Well, he has a lovely wife and family, a beautiful home, money in the bank, and he plays golf with millionaires. What's funny about that?;Casey Stengel;family

For families across the UK who are income-poor, but more than that, whose lives are blighted by worklessness, educational failure, family breakdown, problem debt and poor health, as well as other problems, giving them an extra pound - say through increased benefits - will not address the reason they find themselves in difficulty in the first place.;Iain Duncan Smith;family
Mental illness is the last frontier. The gay thing is part of everyday life now on a show like 'Modern Family,' but mental illness is still full of stigma. Maybe it is time for that to change.;Eric McCormack;family

If you share a common ancestor with somebody, you're related to them. It doesn't mean that you're going to invite them to the family reunion, but it means that you share DNA. I think it's fascinating.;Henry Louis Gates;family
The bottom line is that Wanda Sykes has the longest continuously documented family tree of any African-American we have ever researched.;Henry Louis Gates;family
My family and our neighbors and friends thought of Africa and its Africans as extensions of the stereotyped characters that we saw in movies and on television in films such as 'Tarzan' and in programs such as 'Ramar of the Jungle' and 'Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.';Henry Louis Gates;family
You can say I had a severe case of 'Roots' envy. I wanted to be like Alex Haley, and I wanted to be able to... do my family tree back to the slave ship and then reverse the Middle Passage, as I like to put it, and find the tribe or ethnic group that I was from in Africa.;Henry Louis Gates;family
So when you do your family tree and Margaret Cho does hers, and... Wanda Sykes and John Legend... we're adding to the database that scholars can then draw from to generalize about the complexity of the American experience. And that's the contribution that family trees make to broader scholarship.;Henry Louis Gates;family

Only as far as a man is happily married to himself is he fit for married life and family life in general.;Novalis;family
I have had lots of friends who've been affected by Aids and a very good friend of mine, Oscar Moore, died of Aids and I was with him in his last year quite a bit. And of course he was a man living in a very rich culture with a wealthy family who was able to afford health care.;Emma Thompson;family
I understand what it's like to come with your family, and to uproot yourself and come to another culture. You need a lot of support. People say, 'She's got her daughter she's got her husband.' Yeah, but she hasn't got anyone else.;Emma Thompson;family

The Rooneys are very classy. They're very deliberate with their decision-making. Once you're part of that family, Steeler nation, they treat you with respect. You don't have a lot of rambunctious players running around.;Tony Dorsett;family
In every song I write, whether it's a love song or a political song or a song about family, the one thing that I find is feeling lost and trying to find your way.;Billie Joe Armstrong;family
I wanted the players to feel like they were part of a family, to be conscious of that controlled togetherness as they made that slow entrance onto the field. It had a great psychological effect on the opposing team, too. They'd never seen anything like it.;Hayden Fry;family
I now have two different audiences. There's the one that has been watching my action films for 20 years, and the American family audience. American jokes, less fighting.;Jackie Chan;family

Like all best families, we have our share of eccentricities, of impetuous and wayward youngsters and of family disagreements.;Queen Elizabeth II;family
I'm often asked if I regret not going to Hollywood. I'm glad I didn't go, because if I had I wouldn't have my extended family, which is the fabric of my life. Only recently have I realised how special and unusual it is.;Francesca Annis;family
I have yet to see a drama that puts forward women who are successful and also have a family... they are nearly always seen as victims.;Francesca Annis;family
Music was your real passion, this thing you held dear even above family. It was this relationship that never betrayed you. Once it became your job - this thing that was highly visible, this thing that became about commerce - that's when you were holding onto music like it was a palm tree in a hurricane.;Eddie Vedder;family
A ball player has to be kept hungry to become a big leaguer. That's why no boy from a rich family has ever made the big leagues.;Joe DiMaggio;family

I'd like to have a family.;Maria Sharapova;family

My family and I built my whole career from scratch.;Maria Sharapova;family
My family is awesome.;Miranda Lambert;family
I support concrete and progressive immigration reform based on three primary criteria: family reunification, economic contributions, and humanitarian concerns.;Jeff Bingaman;family
I can't imagine dating a boy, meeting him only outside the home. What's a home and family for if it's not the center of one's life?;Loretta Young;family
My wife, a schoolteacher, very disciplined. If you think I'm tough, trust me, and wait till you see when the children are on the naughty step. It's hilarious. So we decided that I'm going to work like a donkey and provide amazing support for the family.;Gordon Ramsay;family
The dirty little secret is that the pool man, who's making $30,000 a year, is subsidizing the million-dollar mortgage for the family whose pool he cleans. No wonder people want to get rid of tax breaks for corporate jets.;Dee Dee Myers;family
My father, who died a few years ago, was a good, simple, very honest man. His faith and affection for his family was just unassailable, without question.;David Ogden Stiers;family
You go to a restaurant in the States and kids have these game boards at the table. You don't see that in Italy or Spain. It's not because they can't afford to buy them, it's because that's not what eating together as a family is about.;Emeril Lagasse;family
Stay out of the sun, because it is the worst thing in terms of aging. I'm very medical. I come from a medical family.;Nicole Kidman;family

By the time I was 30, nobody would work with me. I was friendless, I was hopeless, I was suicidal, lost my family - I mean, it was bad. Bottomed out, didn't know what I was going to do. I actually thought I was going to be a chef - go to work in a kitchen someplace.;Glenn Beck;family
Never write an advertisement which you wouldn't want your family to read. You wouldn't tell lies to your own wife. Don't tell them to mine.;David Ogilvy;family
Growing up, I was taught that a man has to defend his family. When the wolf is trying to get in, you gotta stand in the doorway.;B. B. King;family

People had this image of the Jacksons as the perfect American family and I destroyed that image. But what people have to understand is writing that book was very healing for me.;LaToya Jackson;family

I can't say it's not painful being estranged from most of my family. I wish it could be otherwise.;LaToya Jackson;family
Outside of being home with my family, I prefer a crowd.;Clive Owen;family
I've never had a very closely connected family. My parents split up when I was young and I was living with my mom for a little while, then I was kind of just on my own really young.

AP promoted me to the White House beat because I knew Clinton, his family, friends, and staff better than anybody in the national press corps. Those contacts helped me break a few stories and get my career in Washington jump-started.;Ron Fournier;family

You know, every family and every business in California knows what it means to go through tough times.;Carly Fiorina;family
I was one those kids who had books on them. Before weddings, Bar Mitzvahs, funerals and anything else where you're actually meant to not be reading, my family would frisk me and take the book away. If they didn't find it by this point in the procedure, I would be sitting over in that corner completely unnoticed just reading my book.;Neil Gaiman;family
A growing awareness of the depth of popular attachment to the family has led some liberals to concede that family is not just a buzzword for reaction.;Christopher Lasch;family

I don't have a saviour or a royal family.;John Malkovich;family
Most Evangelicals claim to be politically non-partisan, and say they only identify with the Republican Party because the Republicans are committed to 'family values.';Tony Campolo;family
I, for one, am quite willing to join the 'forgive, forget and move on' crowd, but it does make me wonder if Evangelicals are going to sound believable when they say that they tend to vote Republican because of their religious commitments to the family.;Tony Campolo;family
The traditional spokespersons for the Evangelicals, such as Chuck Colson and James Dobson, have become alarmed about this drift away from the 'Family Values' issues that they believe should be the overwhelming concerns of Evangelicals.

For my own family, I would always choose the makeshift, surrogate family formed by various characters unrelated by blood.;Anne Tyler;family

I'm not ready to get married, but I have a pretty great family and I'd like that too, someday.;Kristen Stewart;family
I have a great family by the way, but you need to find people who can pull something out from you that might be otherwise unseen.;Kristen Stewart;family
It's not an accident that both my sister and I are writers. Our parents created an accidental Petri dish. My family has great storytellers, and I grew up in a very funny, conversational house and didn't have television. This small family farm was a bubble world that didn't have much to do with reality.;Elizabeth Gilbert;family
A family is very special. So when a family splits up, it's not good, it's never good.;Aung San Suu Kyi;family

After all is said that can be said upon the liquor traffic, its influence is degrading upon the individual, the family, politics and business, and upon everything that you touch in this old world.;Billy Sunday;family
I grew up in a family of strong women and I owe any capacity I have to understand women to my mother and big sister.

In every age there has been a stream of popular opinion that has carried all before it, and given a family character, as it were, to the century.;Mary Wollstonecraft;family
Family involvement is a valuable thing and playing together actively can be the '90s version of it. Instead of just watching, you can do it together... something we don't spend enough time on. We can motivate and excite each other about fitness.;Alan Thicke;family
My priorities are always going to be my husband and my family now. That's a huge, huge thing.;Gwen Stefani;family
I think everybody has their own way of looking at their lives as some kind of pilgrimage. Some people will see their role as a pilgrim in terms of setting up a fine family, or establishing a business inheritance. Everyone's got their own definition.;Eric Clapton;family
Nobody in my family ever thought that I'd a be a model.;Cindy Crawford;family
I miss my family, and I like being a tourist when I go back.;Tim Roth;family

I want a baby and I want a family, for sure.;Rashida Jones;family

My family is my life, and I'll never lose that.;Jessica Simpson;family

In the family sandwich, the older people and the younger ones can recognize one another as the bread. Those in the middle are, for a time, the meat.;Anna Quindlen;family
I've been screaming at the top of my lungs at my family, 'Work out! Work out! Old age is coming!';Cher;family
I'm still very connected to my family, to the world I grew up in. I understand what it means to be afraid that you can't pay a doctor's bill. Or to have to make the choice between buying a band uniform for a seventh-grader and making the insurance payment on time. That will never leave me. It was how I lived until I was well into my adult years.;Elizabeth Warren;family
Like a lot of you, I grew up in a family on the ragged edges of the middle class. My daddy sold carpeting and ended up as a maintenance man. After he had a heart attack, my mom worked the phones at Sears so we could hang on to our house.;Elizabeth Warren;family
I do all of the grocery shopping in my little family. I buy cheese, of many different kinds, sliced packaged meats and poultry, bagels, immense quantities of eggs, pre-made fried chicken. Milk. Bacon. It is insane how much dairy, deli and bakery stuff I buy.;Ben Stein;family
Personally, I think four is the perfect number of children for our particular family. Four is enough to create the frenzied cacophony that my husband and I find so joyful.;Ayelet Waldman;family
Liberals tend to put the onus of your success on society and conservatives on you and your family.;Dennis Prager;family
As a novelist, I mined my history, my family and my memory, but in a very specific way. Writing fiction, I never made use of experiences immediately as they happened. I needed to let things fester in my memory, mature and transmogrify into something meaningful.;Ayelet Waldman;family
Opponents of capital punishment argue that the state has no right to take a murderer's life. Apparently, one fact that abolitionists forget or overlook is that the state is acting not only on behalf of society, but also on behalf of the murdered person and the murdered person's family.;Dennis Prager;family
During the periods in my marriage when I chose to stay home with my kids rather than work as an attorney, it caused me no end of anxiety. Despite the fact that I knew I was contributing to our family by caring for our children, I still felt that my worth was less because I wasn't earning.;Ayelet Waldman;family
For all of higher civilization's recorded history, becoming a man was defined overwhelmingly as taking responsibility for a family.;Dennis Prager;family

I've been to all 50 states, and traveled this whole country, and 90 percent of the people are good folks. The rest of them take after the other side of the family.;Jeff Foxworthy;family
My wife is so analytical with raising kids, and I am not. My feeling is if they turn out good, then that means I was a good daddy and put a lot of effort into it. If they turn out bad, it means they took after her side of the family.;Jeff Foxworthy;family
My father never talked about the sacrifices that the family made for me.;Novak Djokovic;family
It's not common for a woman on television, especially if she's the mom of the family, to be funny. She's usually a straight man or foil.;Martha Plimpton;family

We really were a very musical family. Father managed to buy us a small pump organ, and I just loved this instrument.;Lawrence Welk;family
By 1969, when I celebrated 45 years in the music business, I also had 45 people in our musical family.;Lawrence Welk;family
This character feels so much like my brother. He has two children. He has a wife. He works with me. He chooses to stay in New Hampshire because he wants his kids to grow up in the school they started with. He doesn't want them to lose friends. He is his family's hero.;Adam Sandler;family
The problem with me, as far as getting married and having a family, is that my comedy is so important to me. So I don't know if I'll ever be as good a dad as my dad.;Adam Sandler;family

The pictures of my family were designed to be on a family wall, they were supposed to be together. It was supposed to copy my mother's wall in her house.;Annie Leibovitz;family

We need a better way to talk about eating animals, a way that doesn't ignore or even just shruggingly accept things like habits, cravings, family and history but rather incorporates them into the conversation.

I'm happiest with my family around me.;Amy Winehouse;family
All the songs I write are about human dynamics, whether it's with girlfriends, boyfriends, or family.;Amy Winehouse;family

When I go back to family reunions everybody goes, 'Hey cousin! Hey Auntie!' And I'm like, 'Okay I don't know you, I have no idea who you are.'

How do you rebel in a family of rebels?;Nicolas Cage;family

You might think that after thousands of years of coming up too soon and getting frozen, the crocus family would have had a little sense knocked into it.;Robert Benchley;family
From very early on in my childhood - four, five years old - I felt alien to the human race.

A rumor that followed me forever was that my family was in the mafia. For years I had to live with it. They'd call me the mafia princess, so I rolled with it for the rest of high school. People even joke about it today.;Giuliana Rancic;family

Here's the thing: the unit of reverence in Europe is the family, which is why a child born today of unmarried parents in Sweden has a better chance of growing up in a house with both of his parents than a child born to a married couple in America.

My idea of perfect happiness is a healthy family, peace between nations, and all the critics die.;David Mamet;family
One person may need (or want) more leisure, another more work one more adventure, another more security, and so on.

I really appreciate family. I really can't imagine life without them!;Ice Cube;family

I have acted in a way that violates my obligations to my family and violates my, or any, sense of right and wrong. I apologize first and most importantly to my family. I apologize to the public, whom I promised better.;Eliot Spitzer;family

I'm an actor I'm not a politician. I always kick myself when I talk too much about family, or personal things.;Christian Bale;family
Look, I've got incredible pride for my family. I've absolutely fallen into that cliche of a dad who could just happily talk about my daughter endlessly.;Christian Bale;family
There was a great complexity to my father. He was a devoted family man. But, in the same breath, he simply was not suited to an anchored life. He should have been somebody who had a backpack, an old map, a bit of change in his pocket and that was it - roaming the world.;Christian Bale;family
I can make dressing - or stuffing. Y'all call it stuffing up here, we call it dressing down there. It's really good dressing. That family recipe was passed on, and I love to make that.;Edie Brickell;family

My kids are the future of the Mayweather family and of the Mayweather brand. I feel our family is stronger if we stay together.;Floyd Mayweather, Jr.;family
I have a really, really, really normal family. And by normal I mean we're all nuts on some level. I think you've gotta be a little nuts to pursue any kind of creative job. I was also a really good kid. I know that sounds really dull, but I didn't rebel in the traditional sense.;Anna Paquin;family

The kitchen really is the castle itself. This is where we spend our happiest moments and where we find the joy of being a family.;Mario Batali;family

Given my last position, that I was the first U.S attorney post 9/11 in New Jersey, I understand acutely the pain and sorrow and upset of the family members who lost loved ones that day at the hands of radical Muslim extremists.

And you should be able to give your children the kind of education that allows them to dream even bigger, go even farther and accomplish even more than you could ever imagine.;Cory Booker;family
'I Know You Care' is really personal and fragile for me. For me, it's about losing a family member and also about a breakup. It's about this idea of losing someone for good.;Ellie Goulding;family

In spite of reports about playing with various teams, I'm enjoying retirement with my family and have no plans to play football.;Brett Favre;family
I enjoy being busy, I really do. Remember, I'm the stub end of the railroad. I have no family, so I'm not taking busy time away from people that I should be spending it with. So I'm just relaxing and enjoying it.;Betty White;family
It's a little known fact that one in three family pets gets lost during its lifetime, and approximately 9 million pets enter shelters each year.

I'm thinking of a legacy that I can be proud of and wealth that my grandchildren can use to go to college. So world domination - in terms of providing for my family - is absolutely my goal.;Nicki Minaj;family
When I do get free time, I spend a lot of it at home with my family and my close friends and I think that's what keeps me happy, healthy, grounded, and totally in check.;Leighton Meester;family
My rule is, whatever you were calling me four years ago is what you should be calling me now, because I don't like it when my family or close friends call me Nicki Minaj. To me I'm not Nicki Minaj when I'm with them.;Nicki Minaj;family
What I want to do is tell stories about normal people in the American suburbs. I don't write the book where it's a conspiracy reaching the prime minister I don't write the book with the big serial killer who lops off heads. My setting is a very placid pool of suburbia, family life. And within that I can make pretty big splashes.;Harlan Coben;family
A racially integrated community is a chronological term timed from the entrance of the first black family to the exit of the last white family.;Saul Alinsky;family
Frankly I'm fairly boring or fairly busy. Between writing and family, I have little time for anything else.;Harlan Coben;family
If I'm not writing well, I'm not happy. If I'm not spending enough time with my family, I'm not happy. If I'm not connecting to friends or if I don't work out enough... You get the point. Everything has to be balanced. Nothing should be an extreme.;Harlan Coben;family
I always wanted to be a farmer. There is a tradition of that in my family.;Bjork;family
The Royal family to me are not England, and they are not the flag.;Steven Patrick Morrissey;family
My family, although they're very large on both my parents' sides, they don't know much about their family tree. Occasionally, they try to dig, but they can't get very far, and it's baffling. In Dublin, it seems that so many public records were wiped out it's proven to be very difficult, so I know very little.;Steven Patrick Morrissey;family
Anyone that has a job that takes them away from home, I think, can understand the difficulties in maintaining consistency, not only with your family and those you love but with your friends.;Heath Ledger;family
I'm not sure why no one wants to admit there's a viable audience out there that believes in God and wants to see a movie with their family. The demand is there. The supply is not.;Tyler Perry;family

Jews have deep respect for the Queen and the royal family. We say a prayer for them every Sabbath in synagogue. We recite a special blessing on seeing the Queen.;Jonathan Sacks;family
Whole communities are growing up without fathers or male role models. Bringing up a family in the best of circumstances is not easy. To try to do it by placing the entire burden on women - 91% of single-parent families in Britain are headed by the mother, according to census data - is practically absurd and morally indefensible.;Jonathan Sacks;family
We do not always appreciate the role the Queen has played in one of the most significant changes in the past 60 years: the transformation of Britain into a multi-ethnic, multi-faith society. No one does interfaith better than the Royal family, and it starts with the Queen herself.;Jonathan Sacks;family
I grew up in a family where the internalized understanding was that the kids were going to grow up into a better world. I worry, because I don't think my kids are going to have that. The world is very scary. The world would be scary without the choices the current administration made, but they just exacerbated it. And it ticks me off. I want my kids to have a good life.;Bradley Whitford;family
No journalist has ever been in my house and no photographs have ever been taken of where I live. I don't parade my family out for display, which is the way it will stay.;Tom Hanks;family
I've always wanted to get into acting, ever since I was younger. I'd put on shows for my family and run around play dress-up all the time. I think I was 4 when I told them I wanted to do movies.;Emma Roberts;family
We fight a lot, you know, but that's family. We may be dysfunctional but we're still family.;Star Jones;family
I like all the families in the U.K. But what I like about the idea of the royal family is... they seem like they're well educated and there's something admirable about them. And the Queen... she reminds me of my grandma.;will.i.am;family
I'm from a nice, suburban, middle-class family, but my tattoos remind me where I've been.;Tom Hardy;family
If you live in a ghetto and really want not to just change your life and your family's life but change your ghetto's life, make your ghetto a good neighbourhood, learn science try to be like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.;will.i.am;family
If you live in a good neighborhood, you drive home and there's a bank. There's grocery stores and big houses - but no motels. What that tells you psychologically is you protect your money and buy good things for your family to eat in your nice big house.;will.i.am;family
Respectable means rich, and decent means poor. I should die if I heard my family called decent.;Thomas Mann;family
The countries who do the best in international comparisons, whether it's Finland or Japan, Denmark or Singapore, do well because they have professional teachers who are respected, and they also have family and community which support learning.;Howard Gardner;family
The functions of the family in a highly differentiated society are not to be interpreted as functions directly on behalf of the society, but on behalf of personality.;Talcott Parsons;family
My family moved a lot as a kid. We started in Colorado, where I lived for five years. We moved to Chicago for two years, to San Francisco for one year, Connecticut for seven, Oregon for a couple years, and then I went to school. So I was always moving, I'm still always moving.;Gus Van Sant;family
There is a common theme, though, in the stories I have told, which are usually associations of characters or families that are formed outside of a family circle.;Gus Van Sant;family
If I'm diagnosed with cancer I might become despondent, but someone young might not, and they might need connections with somebody outside their circle of family because their family is so despondent.;Gus Van Sant;family
My family moved a lot as a kid. We started in Colorado, where I lived for five years. We moved to Chicago for two years, to San Francisco for one year, Connecticut for seven, Oregon for a couple years, and then I went to school.;Gus Van Sant;family
Because I didn't have brothers, I was always interested in the kids down the street that had four brothers in their family, so I became one of them - but it was not my family.;Gus Van Sant;family
According to the Small Business Administration, more than 70 percent of all family businesses do not survive through the second generation, and 8 percent do not make it to a third.;Kit Bond;family
I wasn't looking to get into TV. My family was in the movie business, so I was never interested in that world.;Giada De Laurentiis;family
The summer before I went to culinary school, my family wanted me to take a job on a movie to make sure that I was making the right decision. I think they hoped I would change my mind about culinary school.;Giada De Laurentiis;family
My family truly believes they are better cooks than I am. They see me as Giada, not as a celebrity chef. To them I'm just me - their granddaughter, niece, etc., and they're older and wiser. I like that because it keeps you grounded.;Giada De Laurentiis;family
I want to deal with somebody who comes from another country to the United States and has a family that comes. I don't care if it's a black family from Jamaica or a Hispanic family from Mexico. These issues need to be dealt with, but they need to be dealt with in the entertaining way.;Harvey Weinstein;family

You're almost in a haze because you don't really know where you are half the time: You're in a hotel room one moment, and the next thing you know, you're onstage performing for 60,000 people, then you're back on an airplane.

Spending $1 for a brand new house would feel very, very good. Spending $1,000 for a ham sandwich would feel very, very bad.

But as with physical pain, fiscal pain can depend on the individual, and everyone has a different threshold.;Jeffrey Kluger;family
It's one of the worst-kept secrets of family life that all parents have a preferred son or daughter, and the rules for acknowledging it are the same everywhere: The favored kids recognize their status and keep quiet about it - the better to preserve the good thing they've got going and to keep their siblings off their back.;Jeffrey Kluger;family

My family has very strong women. My mother never laughed at my dream of Africa, even though everyone else did because we didn't have any money, because Africa was the 'dark continent', and because I was a girl.;Jane Goodall;family
When I look back over my life it's almost as if there was a plan laid out for me - from the little girl who was so passionate about animals who longed to go to Africa and whose family couldn't afford to put her through college. Everyone laughed at my dreams. I was supposed to be a secretary in Bournemouth.;Jane Goodall;family

For me, it's about the way I carry myself and the way I treat other people. My relationship and how I feel about God and what He does for me, is something deeply personal. It's where I came from, my family, I was brought up in a religious household and that's very important to me.;Beyonce Knowles;family
While I have felt lonely many times in my life, the oddest feeling of all was after my mother, Lucille, died. My father had already died, but I always had some attachment to our big family while she was alive. It seems strange to say now that I felt so lonely, yet I did.;Bill Murray;family

I just want to have a great relationship with my child and have a great family dynamic.;Tori Spelling;family
As a child, I had to get up early for school or work. I'd get ready by myself. I'd set my alarm to wake me up very early in the morning, and be off to work, the family driver driving me every morning. I did it alone, my parents never coming in to wake me up.;Janet Jackson;family
I need to work to support my family.;Tori Spelling;family
My dream, maybe because of my family, of course, was to be a painter. I chose in one moment the direction of textiles from textiles I went to fashion.;Roberto Cavalli;family
But for me, I thought you made a record, you got on a bus, went out and played your shows and made a lot of money. That was the way it was supposed to go down. But there's a lot more to it than that. There are a lot of early mornings, late nights, a lot of traveling, a lot of being away from home, being away from your family.;Jason Aldean;family
Short of baseball and my family, it was gaming. And gaming is a $20-million to $200-million multi-year effort. It's an insane, stupid and utterly irresponsible act. But I did it.;Curt Schilling;family

The Royal Family are not like you and me. They live in houses so big that you can walk round all day and never need to meet your spouse. The Queen and Prince Philip have never shared a bedroom in their lives. They don't even have breakfast together.;A. N. Wilson;family
With the counseling of my family doctor, my mother ended up turning to Weight Watchers and their children's program. I went to weekly meetings, got counseling and would exercise with my peers who were my size. It was the first time I saw a proper children's portion size, and it wasn't two burgers, it was one.;Ginnifer Goodwin;family
I was the youngest of my entire family so you are tap-dancing to try to get the attention of your older cousins. I really hit my social stride in 6th grade, but before that I was a pretty big dork. You learn how to be amusing and how to work for it.;Sloane Crosley;family

I'm over the moon to be involved in the 'Doctor Who' Christmas special. I can't quite believe it as it's a part of the family tradition at the Jenkins household. I heard the news that I got the role on my 30th birthday and it was the best birthday present ever.;Katherine Jenkins;family
You have no idea how humiliating it was, as a boy, to suddenly have all your clothes, your toys, snatched by the bailiff. I mean we were a middle-class family, it's not as if it was happening up and down the street. It made me ashamed, I felt dirty.;John le Carre;family

In my family, we let our boys have a say in what veggie side they want for dinner that night. We list off a handful of options and get them excited about helping to plan the dinner menu. They're much more inclined to finish their plates when they've helped decide what goes on them.;Cat Cora;family
To me, money is the ability to create lifelong experiences for my family and myself, to educate my children and a way to give back to humanity.;Cat Cora;family
I've always been part of comedy.

Because when he didn't laugh, you were in trouble!;Leslie Nielsen;family
I've been experimenting more and more with LN2, liquid nitrogen. I've used it in battle on 'Iron Chef America,' but have also made some great ice creams at home for my family. Since it freezes basically on contact, you can have ice cream ready in mere minutes.;Cat Cora;family
My family brought me up to be very respectful of people.;Emma Bunton;family
When I'm home, the heart and soul of our family is in the kitchen. Growing up, my parents both worked, so dinnertime was for family - the TV was off. I think it's important to grab that time and really make it special, even after a tough day.;Cat Cora;family
My parents did a great job raising me and my two sisters. We all graduated from high school and we all graduated from college. So, to be a good representative of my family is probably my greatest accomplishment thus far.;Robert Griffin III;family

Television knows no night. It is perpetual day. TV embodies our fear of the dark, of night, of the other side of things.;Jean Baudrillard;fear
We are biological creatures. We are born, we live, we die. There is no transcendent purpose to existence. At best we are creatures of reason, and by using reason we can cure ourselves of emotional excess. Purged of both hope and fear, we find courage in the face of helplessness, insignificance and uncertainty.;Jonathan Sacks;fear
My greatest fear is feeling like a professional novelist. Somebody who creates characters, who sits down and has pieces of paper taped to the wall - what's going to happen in this scene, or this act.

You know I never used to be a bad flyer, but I did start to have a fear of flying after I shot a movie where I was terrorized on a plane. I made Wes Craven's 'Red Eye'.

What people fear most about tragedy is its randomness - a taxi cab jumps the curb and hits a pedestrian, a gun misfires and kills a bystander.

Less base the fear of death than fear of life.;Edward Young;fear
I call on the Iranian people: it is not too late to replace the corrupt regime and return to your glorious Persian heritage, a heritage of culture and values and not of bombs and missiles...

You have to have fear to take risks - and I want to at least try.;Seann William Scott;fear

Another parent's different approach raises the possibility that you've made a mistake with your child.

More than fantasy or even science fiction, Ray Bradbury wrote horror, and like so many great horror writers he was himself utterly without fear, of anything.

I have a fear of poverty in old age. I have this vision of myself living in a skip and eating cat food. It's because I'm freelance, and I've never had a proper job. I don't have a pension, and my savings are dwindling. I always thought someone would just come along and look after me.;Jenny Eclair;fear

I'm not the type of person to live in fear. I think positively.;David Guetta;fear

A line from one of my 1997 columns - 'Do one thing every day that scares you' - is now widely attributed to Eleanor Roosevelt, though I have yet to see any evidence that she ever said it and I don't believe she did. She said some things about fear, but not that thing.;Mary Schmich;fear

My biggest fear in life is to be average.;M. Night Shyamalan;fear

With all of the divisiveness that is going on in the country we live in, so much of it is based around just fear of the other.

There's nothing to be afraid of.;Ellen Barkin;fear

We will be safer from terrorist attack only when we have earned the respect of all other nations instead of their fear, respect for our values and not merely our weapons.;Theodore C. Sorensen;fear
I've been quite fascinated by the relative insignificance of human existence, the shortness of life.

Let no man fear to die, we love to sleep all, and death is but the sounder sleep.;Francis Beaumont;fear

Of the primary emotions, fear is the one that bears most directly on survival. Children show fear. Adults try not to, maybe because it's shameful, or, in some circumstances, dangerous. The fear response is automatic, though, and your body runs through its reflexes whether you want it to or not.;Sebastian Junger;fear
People don't want to talk about death, just like they don't want to talk about computer security. Maybe I should have named my workstation Fear. People are so motivated by fear.;Dan Farmer;fear

I had a fear of becoming anything, a fear of becoming a specialist. I might have become a doctor, but if you become a doctor, that's your specialty in life and you are defined by it.

Celebrity or no celebrity, I think a lot of females deal with the fear of being abducted.;Elisha Cuthbert;fear
See, the 'On the Road' that came out in 1957 was censored. A lot of the honesty of it, the bitter honesty, is in the original scroll version that came out in 2007 on the 50-year anniversary. Back then, there was so much post-Second World War fear that was imposed on everybody - 'You must live life this way' - and these guys were bored.;Garrett Hedlund;fear
With Alexander's cancer, I was definitely brought to my knees for the first time because of the fear factor.;Cathy Freeman;fear

Do what you fear most and you control fear.;Tom Hopkins;fear

One of the most gratifying things I get as an artist is when people watch me do these different demonstrations, and they in some way feel empowered by what I'm doing so they can confront their own fears. Maybe it's the fear of getting in an elevator maybe it's the fear of going on a plane and seeing the world.;Criss Angel;fear
I approach my character with the question: What would an animal think? How would an animal respond? A lot of times, it's quick action and no fear, and sometimes it's irrational fear. You don't always know.;Victoria Pratt;fear

You can't be afraid to put out a fire if you're a fireman. You can't be afraid to be a police officer and carry a gun if you're afraid to get up and go out there. So you've got to put that fear to the side and go out in faith to overcome that.;Duane Chapman;fear
Of all the hazards, fear is the worst.;Sam Snead;fear
